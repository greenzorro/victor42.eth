<p><em>Image from Dribbble.</em></p><p>The title might be misleading. I&rsquo;m not discussing the UX of messaging apps, but the reading experience of chat content.</p><h2 id=number-ocd>Number OCD</h2><p>My supervisor recently asked for my phone and ID numbers for some paperwork. We were chatting on DingTalk. I replied &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and sent:</p><blockquote>
<p>×× (My Name)
Phone: 186××××××××
ID: 360103××××××××××××</p></blockquote><p>I stared at the message and thought I could do better. So, I resent it:</p><blockquote>
<p>×× (My Name)
Phone: 186 ×××× ××××
ID: 360 103 ×××× ×××× ××××</p></blockquote><p>I mentioned it was easier to read. My supervisor quipped, &ldquo;OCD kicking in again, eh?&rdquo; I replied, a bit pretentiously, &ldquo;User experience is everywhere,&rdquo; followed by a grinning emoji.</p><p>That was that. But since I&rsquo;d mentioned UX, I figured I&rsquo;d explore it further. It wasn&rsquo;t just me being nitpicky. My initial message wasn&rsquo;t exactly user-friendly.</p><p>Formatting a reply is a design task, tied to the user and goal. The user was clear: my supervisor on DingTalk mobile. But the goal? I hadn&rsquo;t asked. She needed the numbers for documents, but she wouldn&rsquo;t be preparing them herself. She&rsquo;d pass the info along. How? Jot it down or forward it? That&rsquo;s a big difference!</p><h3 id=writing-it-down>Writing it Down</h3><p>If she was writing it down, it&rsquo;d likely be the old-fashioned &ldquo;read-memorize-write&rdquo; method. I can&rsquo;t control the writing, but the reading and memorizing depend on my formatting.</p><p>Research suggests people can only remember about 7 digits at a time. Anything longer needs chunking. We remember five and seven-character poems. Nine-character poems exist, but they&rsquo;re rare. Qu Yuan&rsquo;s <a class=link href=http://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%A6%BB%E9%AA%9A/1045 target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Li Sao</em></a> is an exception, but even there, most meaningful content stays within 7 characters, thanks to the modal particle &ldquo;兮&rdquo;.</p><p>Seven is the <em>limit</em>, though, not ideal. Think about verification codes: usually 4 or 6 digits. We can recall 4 digits easily, but 6-digit codes get broken into 3+3. This suggests the sweet spot for easy recall is under 6 characters. China&rsquo;s 11-digit phone numbers are commonly read as 3+4+4. We say, &ldquo;Call my 186 number.&rdquo; Online, the middle 4 digits are often masked. We also tend to remember the last 4 digits. This shows how ingrained this grouping is. ID numbers aren&rsquo;t usually split up visually, but they have inherent sections: 6 (region) + 4 (year) + 4 (month/day) + 4 (last four). That&rsquo;s likely how most people memorize them.</p><p>As an aside, is the magic number 4 or 5? I lean towards 4, though I lack hard proof. But the examples above hint at it. Bank card numbers, too: different lengths, but when deliberately grouped, they never exceed 4 digits per chunk.</p><p>However you format a long number string, that&rsquo;s how the recipient will read and memorize it. We should all offer this courtesy to each other.</p><h3 id=forwarding-on-mobile>Forwarding on Mobile</h3><p>Back to the point. If the numbers were to be forwarded and copied into a system, things change entirely.</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t know if the system handled spaces. Pasting the &ldquo;easy-read&rdquo; format might result in &ldquo;186 ×××× ××&rdquo;. Also, my supervisor, on Android, couldn&rsquo;t use clipboard tools like Pin. Extracting the numbers would be a hassle.</p><p><img src=../../https:/cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-12/12-09/1.jpg loading=lazy></p><p><em>Mobile IM often forces you to copy the entire message.</em></p><p>So, for copying from IM, the best format is:</p><blockquote>
<p>Name:</blockquote>××</blockquote>Phone:</blockquote>186××××××××</blockquote>ID:</blockquote>360103××××××××××××</blockquote></p></blockquote><p>This reminds me of my WeChat public account. I mostly just post articles, so I set up an auto-reply directing people to my Weibo.</p><p>For a while, the auto-reply just said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t check this account often. Contact me via private message on Sina Weibo: @我_ColaChan.&rdquo;</p><p>Then I messaged myself. It was a pain to copy just the nickname. So I changed it: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t check this account often. Contact me on Sina Weibo. Reply &lsquo;Weibo&rsquo; for my username.&rdquo; Replying &ldquo;Weibo&rdquo; triggered a message with just &ldquo;@我_ColaChan&rdquo;.</p><p>An extra step, but much easier to extract the information.</p><h2 id=eliminating-typos>Eliminating Typos</h2><p>Text chat isn&rsquo;t just about numbers. Everyday conversation is key. What defines &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; here?</p><p>In middle school, we didn&rsquo;t have cell phones. We chatted on QQ via computer. A classmate once said chatting with me was reassuring. Why? Because I never made typos.</p><p>Thinking back, it&rsquo;s true. Life&rsquo;s faster now, and with auto-suggestions, typos happen. But attitude matters. I proofread my messages and always fix typos.</p><p>Many people don&rsquo;t check their messages. They don&rsquo;t check after typing, or even <em>during</em>. They just fire off a message. Even if they spot a mistake, they often can&rsquo;t be bothered to fix it, assuming the other person will get it. This leads to gibberish like &ldquo;Enai&rdquo; (should be &ldquo;En Ai,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;love&rdquo;) or &ldquo;Bu hui ni o&rdquo; (should be &ldquo;Bu hui you ni o,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;won&rsquo;t have you&rdquo;). Misspelled keywords require serious guesswork, even considering homophones and keyboard layouts. I&rsquo;ve dealt with printers and developers whose messages are incredibly hard to decipher. Sure, being busy is understandable. But typo-free chat is a better experience for everyone.</p><h2 id=language-is-serious>Language is Serious</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten messages like this before, a jumbled mess:</p><blockquote>
<p>are you there
Does UI need hand-drawing?
Can&rsquo;t do it without hand-drawing?
No response to resume Is it not enough experience
What are the ui specifications do I need to look at both ios andriod
Are you there are you there、
What to do without a portfolio?</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s not verbatim, but it captures the essence. Missing punctuation, misused punctuation, spaces instead of commas, extra spaces, mixed Chinese and English punctuation, misspelled words, misused words, no clear topics&mldr; It&rsquo;s a catalog of common communication errors.</p><p>Language&rsquo;s main purpose is communication. It&rsquo;s the agreed-upon system for expressing concepts. Ignoring language norms is like disconnecting from that system. It&rsquo;s a big deal. Even in casual texts, I think it&rsquo;s important to use &ldquo;的,&rdquo; &ldquo;地,&rdquo; and &ldquo;得&rdquo; correctly. These details are often overlooked. It&rsquo;s not about language purity; it&rsquo;s about making things easier for the reader. Standard language helps.</p><h2 id=the-mindset-of-writing-a-press-release>The Mindset of Writing a Press Release</h2><p>Think of your messages like press releases. Unless you&rsquo;re just shooting the breeze with a close friend, there&rsquo;s usually a point.</p><p>The jumbled message above, besides being imprecise, suffers from scattered topics. How do you even answer that? If you&rsquo;re confused and need help, write a clear request for help. The example above isn&rsquo;t even an outline.</p><p>Clear messages have structure. Start with a sentence stating the topic, then elaborate, point by point. If you&rsquo;re informing someone, state the key facts. If you need something, explain why, and ideally, offer a solution. If you&rsquo;re reporting a problem, give enough details for troubleshooting.</p><p>When friends ask for computer help, they often just say, &ldquo;My computer&rsquo;s broken, help!&rdquo; And then they wait for me to ask questions. I wish just <em>once</em> someone would proactively tell me the error message, if it&rsquo;s happened before, when it started, what they did before and after, what they tried, and what the results were.</p><p>Imagine a robbery. The police arrive, and the victim just keeps saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been robbed! Catch the thief!&rdquo; The case won&rsquo;t get solved.</p><p>Focused conversations are efficient. A ten-minute explanation can drag on for an hour due to poor communication. Wasting someone&rsquo;s time is a cardinal sin.</p><h2 id=modern-big-character-posters>Modern Big-Character Posters</h2><p>China has a thing for slogan banners and posters. For urban planning: &ldquo;Gather all forces, plan water management, build a harmonious city, promote the water town image, and establish a legacy.&rdquo; For construction safety: &ldquo;Safety creates happiness, negligence brings pain. Safety is efficiency, safety is happiness.&rdquo; For hospitals: &ldquo;Create a safe hospital, build harmonious doctor-patient relations.&rdquo;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s not even get into the slogans themselves. The point is, the people behind these didn&rsquo;t consider their audience or tone. A slogan near a military area was actually good: &ldquo;Obey the Party&rsquo;s command, be able to win battles, and have a good work style.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hierarchical and logical. Most importantly, it&rsquo;s clear and unambiguous.</p><p>News and official outlets use vague language to be inclusive and cover all bases. But this isn&rsquo;t just a media thing. We&rsquo;ve all encountered people who write in an overly formal or flowery style at work. Think of those landing pages: a confusing illustration with shopping carts and money flying everywhere, and text like, &ldquo;Enjoy endless discounts.&rdquo;</p><p>I remember one ad clearly. I forget the brand, but it showed traditional soy sauce making. The spokesperson, standing by a field of drying soybeans, said plainly, &ldquo;Just dry it here, just rely on the sun.&rdquo; A less direct approach might have been: &ldquo;XX hectares of soybean processing, natural air-drying.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s uninspiring. No matter how accurate or fancy, it lacks imagery.</p><p>You can see the ad&rsquo;s directness here: <a class=link href=http://t.cn/RcxcZ3I target=_blank rel=noopener>http://t.cn/RcxcZ3I</a>.</p><p>It reminds me of a joke with my classmates:</p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The rolling Yangtze River flows eastward&mldr;"</blockquote>&ldquo;Get to the point!"</blockquote>&ldquo;The river flows east!"</blockquote></p></blockquote><h2 id=topic-guardian>Topic Guardian</h2><p>After I started working, someone commented on my chat style again, saying I was &ldquo;chatting with my life.&rdquo; They explained that with others, it&rsquo;s a back-and-forth. With me, they&rsquo;d see me &ldquo;typing&rdquo; for ages, sometimes over ten minutes. They&rsquo;d return from getting water to find a massive, multi-paragraph message from me, addressing every tangent from the earlier conversation.</p><p>So, I do have that habit! I don&rsquo;t let topics die; I need closure. I can see how this would be tiring in casual chats. I don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to be like this. I&rsquo;d prefer to stick to one thing. But once the conversation derails, even if it&rsquo;s not my fault, I feel compelled to keep it going. If the other person is fine with this style, I&rsquo;m the one who ends up exhausted.</p><p>Long messages have pros and cons. The downside is making people wait. But the upside is preventing further tangents. If, mid-reply, something reminds the other person of something else, they might interrupt, creating more branches. It&rsquo;s very common.</p><p>This is a dilemma. Wasting time is bad, so shouldn&rsquo;t I avoid long waits? But if I don&rsquo;t control the topics, forgotten points might need revisiting later, which <em>also</em> wastes time. In text chat, prioritizing the other person&rsquo;s experience means choosing the less time-consuming option. Letting topics explode seems like a lesser evil.</p><h2 id=oh-hehe-grin>Oh, Hehe, [Grin]</h2><p>These are the worst replies, the ultimate conversation killers. Why? They&rsquo;re short and meaningless, yes. But the real problem is they don&rsquo;t reflect the sender&rsquo;s <em>state</em>. They replied, but didn&rsquo;t actually <em>respond</em>. You don&rsquo;t know if they understood; they could have been typing those replies mindlessly.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like sending an email with no loading indicator or confirmation. The compose window stays open. You close it, and the email&rsquo;s nowhere: not in Sent, Outbox, Drafts, Inbox, Junk, <em>or</em> Spam. WTF?</p><p>It sounds ridiculous, but these conversations happen all the time. An Android developer asked me for an asset. I asked how he planned to use it – fixed size or .9 patch? He replied, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; I thought he&rsquo;d hit send accidentally. But after 30 seconds, not even a &ldquo;typing&rdquo; indicator. The topic died, forcing me to start a new round of questions.</p><p>Tech people <em>should</em> understand feedback. The TCP/IP handshake is a prime example: Client sends to server: &ldquo;I want to connect.&rdquo; Server replies: &ldquo;Is this what you sent? Is it you?&rdquo; Client confirms: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me, let&rsquo;s connect.&rdquo;</p><p>Humans are good at context, machines less so. But even with context, clear feedback is crucial. At the very least, reply with &ldquo;OK&rdquo; or &ldquo;Received.&rdquo; If there&rsquo;s a choice, repeat the chosen option.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Looking back at my IM interactions, there&rsquo;s a clear divide. Some people are a breeze to communicate with; others make you want to just call. The same task, expressed differently in text, leads to vastly different experiences.</p><p>Experience design is everywhere, and it&rsquo;s practical. Strip away the methodologies, and you&rsquo;re left with one core principle: Put yourself in the other person&rsquo;s shoes.</p></section><footer class=article-footer>
