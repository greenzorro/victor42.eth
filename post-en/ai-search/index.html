<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a truly reliable AI search tool. I figured I&rsquo;d just test it with some representative questions. Turns out, I was in over my head.</p><h2 id=starting-with-real-life-problems>Starting with Real-Life Problems</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve used some real-world questions as test cases, and most AI search tools fall short.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that the questions are hard. The trick is how the AI goes about searching and pulling out the answer.</p><h3 id=what-kind-of-fish-is-guyanyu>What kind of fish is &ldquo;Guyanyu&rdquo;?</h3><p>It&rsquo;s a type of edible flatfish. This is a trick question – &ldquo;Guyanyu&rdquo; is a colloquial, shortened name used in fish markets, not the scientific one.</p><p>AI finds useful info, but also noise:</p><ul>
<li>Some only consider &ldquo;Guyanyu,&rdquo; ignoring homophones, leading to wrong answers like &ldquo;spotted shad.&rdquo;</li><li>Others consider the homophone &ldquo;Guyanyu,&rdquo; but mistake it for the spotted shad.</li></ul><p>Reasoning models see they&rsquo;re different, but can&rsquo;t tell which one you&rsquo;re asking about, so they list both.</p><p>Sometimes, because there&rsquo;s so much more info on &ldquo;Guyanyu&rdquo; (the flatfish), the AI jumps to a conclusion and gets it right, accidentally.</p><h3 id=whats-the-relationship-between-liu-chuanzhi-and-bike-sharing>What&rsquo;s the relationship between Liu Chuanzhi and bike-sharing?</h3><p>There&rsquo;s not much of a direct link, but there&rsquo;s a two-step indirect one: his daughter, Liu Qing, and Didi (which she leads), which owns Qingju Bike.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know their relationship when I asked. I wanted the <em>most significant</em> chain of influence, not the most direct.</p><p>Non-reasoning models focus on Legend Capital&rsquo;s investment in ofo, mostly ignoring Liu Qing.</p><p>Reasoning models are smarter, recognizing Liu Qing&rsquo;s importance, but stop at Didi. They assume Didi is just ride-hailing and don&rsquo;t dig into Didi&rsquo;s connection with Qingju, often concluding: The Liu family has a big impact on transportation, but little direct connection to bike-sharing.</p><h3 id=hangzhou-was-called-linan-in-ancient-times-why-did-this-name-get-given-to-linan-district-today>Hangzhou was called Lin&rsquo;an in ancient times. Why did this name get &ldquo;given&rdquo; to Lin&rsquo;an District today?</h3><p>This used to confuse me. It wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;given.&rdquo; I had it backwards. Lin&rsquo;an County came first, <em>then</em> the Southern Song Lin&rsquo;an Prefecture. The Southern Song might have been inspired by the county, but they were different places. The Southern Song capital was in downtown Hangzhou, not Lin&rsquo;an. After the Song Dynasty fell, Lin&rsquo;an Prefecture went back to being Hangzhou, while Lin&rsquo;an County stayed Lin&rsquo;an. Later, Lin&rsquo;an became a district of Hangzhou.</p><p>Because the question itself is misleading, non-reasoning models mostly go with the incorrect assumption, talking about commemorating history or the glory of the Southern Song.</p><p>Reasoning models do well here, mostly getting it right. They spot the chronological order and point out the flawed &ldquo;given to&rdquo; phrasing.</p><h3 id=what-was-the-highest-throughput-of-shanghais-port-during-the-colonial-period-how-did-it-compare-to-the-largest-ports-at-the-time>What was the highest throughput of Shanghai&rsquo;s port during the colonial period? How did it compare to the largest ports at the time?</h3><p>I was just curious. I still don&rsquo;t know, but I found that most AI search tools can&rsquo;t answer this.</p><p>A somewhat reliable source is the Shanghai Port Chronicle on Baidu Baike, mentioning 14 million tons before the Second Sino-Japanese War, ranking 7th globally.</p><p>Data for other ports is either unavailable or made up by the AI. Some less intelligent AIs with big search volumes found <em>some</em> useful data (at least with references).</p><p>These are all real problems. I had tons of questions. I was a &ldquo;walking encyclopedia&rdquo; as a kid, and many quick searches turned up nothing. This made me doubt AI search.</p><h2 id=not-all-problems-are-created-equal>Not All Problems Are Created Equal</h2><p>AI search is a mixed bag. Some do well on certain questions, others don&rsquo;t. I started looking for patterns: How can I tell which AI is good at what? And how should I pick an AI search product?</p><p>First, reasoning models are generally better, but not all are smart enough. Gemini 2.0 Flash and Kimi K1.5 aren&rsquo;t great. In my tests, Gemini 2.0 Flash couldn&rsquo;t answer these, but R1 could.</p><p>Search method matters, too.</p><p>Interestingly, Grok 3 has strong reasoning, even without &ldquo;Think,&rdquo; but can&rsquo;t answer the &ldquo;Guyanyu&rdquo; question. Looking at its searches, I get why. It might be forcing a translation. With a weird Chinese name like &ldquo;Guyanyu,&rdquo; it mistranslates, doesn&rsquo;t search for the shad or flatfish, and probably searches for things like &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; and &ldquo;eye&rdquo; separately. It finds nothing useful and makes stuff up.</p><p>Search volume is also key.</p><p>which country does Windsurf IDE come from?</p><p>It&rsquo;s from the US. I thought, &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; Foreign AI search did great, even finding Mountain View, California. I tested domestic ones. Kimi and Yuewen can search English, so I asked in English. Finding the US was easy, but not the city.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> that simple. Which article on Windsurf IDE would mention the city? At most, they&rsquo;d say the country. To get the full answer, the AI needs to find Codium (the company behind it), then find the city from Codium&rsquo;s site, job postings, or Product Hunt. That takes reasoning and multi-step searching!</p><p>This made me realize: questions we find easy can be tough for AI. It&rsquo;s not that AI is dumb; we underestimate the complexity.</p><p>Even with a search engine, finding Windsurf IDE&rsquo;s country is easy, but the city isn&rsquo;t a one-search deal.</p><p>So, I came up with a rough way to evaluate AI search: four quadrants based on AI ability and search ability:</p><p><img src=../../https:/cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-02/Snipaste_2025-02-26_12-52-46.png loading=lazy></p><p>I underestimated the &ldquo;Guyanyu,&rdquo; Liu Chuanzhi/bike-sharing, and Lin&rsquo;an questions. I thought they were type D, but they&rsquo;re type B. The Shanghai port question is a trickier type A.</p><p>Mistaking type A for C, and B for D, leads to disappointment.</p><p>The biggest problem? We don&rsquo;t know the category when we ask, and we often underestimate the difficulty.</p><p>But AI search is a tool, and tools should serve us, right? It&rsquo;s not doing a great job yet, and that&rsquo;s not our fault; it&rsquo;s on them to improve.</p><p>To reliably answer type B, agents like Grok 3 Deep Search and OpenAI Deep Research are crucial. They need multi-step searches, deep dives into relationships, source reliability checks, and conflicting info evaluation.</p><h2 id=making-the-most-of-ai-search>Making the Most of AI Search</h2><p>Deep search for everything is too slow.</p><p>As someone in the AI community said: Since we can&rsquo;t make AI accommodate humans yet, let humans accommodate AI.</p><h3 id=use-multiple-products-simultaneously>Use Multiple Products Simultaneously</h3><p>To save time and get decent answers, ditch the &ldquo;one-tool-fits-all&rdquo; idea. Think a bit about which quadrant a question likely falls into. Each has reliable AI search products; choose accordingly.</p><p>It takes more thought, but saves time. Your call.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go backwards. Type D is easiest; any AI search tool works.</p><p>Type C needs a lot of searching, but no reasoning. If the webpage exists, the answer is there. Example:</p><p>which country does Windsurf IDE come from?</p><p>Kimi does well on these. Products with 50 search entries are also good. Consider long-tail knowledge as this type.</p><p>Type B has two scenarios:</p><ol>
<li>The answer&rsquo;s there, but with lots of conflicting noise.</li><li>The answer&rsquo;s not in the core search results, but is abundant in incidentally searched terms. My earlier questions are examples.</li></ol><p>These need strong reasoning models, like R1, Grok 3 Think, or O3 Mini. Search capability isn&rsquo;t as crucial; a dozen or two dozen sources are enough. Type B is easily mistaken for D. If answers are bad, realize this.</p><p>Finally, type A. I&rsquo;m not sure any current AI search can handle these reliably. Info is scarce. You&rsquo;ll probably have to sift through search engines manually. If you want to try AI, use deep search/research.</p><h3 id=give-up-on-one-shot-answers>Give Up on One-Shot Answers</h3><p>The goal is to solve problems. Don&rsquo;t expect a perfect answer in one go. Let that go, and you&rsquo;ll find more options.</p><p>Back to:</p><p>which country does Windsurf IDE come from?</p><p>If the first question doesn&rsquo;t give the city, ask:</p><p>which city?</p><p>For reasoning models, the odds of success go way up. Use multi-turn dialogue; you&rsquo;d do the same with a search engine.</p><p>For tricky type A questions, like I said, accommodate the AI.</p><p>Ask in different ways, skim the sources, and judge usefulness by titles. Put useful ones in a knowledge base, and use AI to RAG it for the answer. Tools include NotebookLM, Tencent&rsquo;s iMa, Perplexity, and AI clients like Cherry Studio.</p><h3 id=pay-attention-to-language-differences>Pay Attention to Language Differences</h3><p>Language matters. An AI limited to Chinese can&rsquo;t answer English-world nuances; foreign AI can&rsquo;t answer questions about your local school&rsquo;s enrollment plan.</p><p>A test:</p><p>wildfire trends in CA in the last 10 years</p><p>Ask about something abroad in English. If most results are Chinese webpages, it can&rsquo;t search English well and is only good for Chinese topics.</p><p>Most domestic products have R1, so reasoning is good. Choosing a Chinese-world AI search is easy: find one with a large search volume.</p><p>If you need English and foreign info, foreign products are best. If that&rsquo;s inconvenient, test domestic products with English questions.</p><p>Finally, models and products mentioned are time-sensitive (February 2025). Conclusions might change, but the factors for understanding and evaluating AI search remain useful.</p></section><footer class=article-footer>
