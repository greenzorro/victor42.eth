&gt;trip to Dunhuang&lt;/a&gt; last month. Ever since we got back, she&amp;rsquo;s been begging to go to Crescent Spring again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say no more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a desert trip during the National Day holiday means avoiding tourist hotspots like Shapotou and Xiangshawan. After some research, I landed on a less-traveled route: Bayannur – Alxa – Wuhai – Shizuishan – Yinchuan. The entire drive was a breeze, with green routes on the map app all the way. The attractions weren&amp;rsquo;t crowded either. We spent two days playing in the sand and two days sightseeing, discovering a desert and Gobi landscape different from Dunhuang&amp;rsquo;s. This &amp;ldquo;reverse tourism&amp;rdquo; trip was a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/edb00e149254372e350a5e9496f2847c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this route winds through western Inner Mongolia, with a small portion dipping into northern Ningxia. It largely follows the Yellow River through the western section of the Hetao Plain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/534742728de3caa908bc33605f12525d.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner Mongolia has a vast east-west span with diverse landscapes. The east boasts the Hulunbuir Grasslands, but since it&amp;rsquo;s north of Harbin, October is already winter. The grass turns yellow and it&amp;rsquo;s bone-chillingly cold. The central region offers both grasslands and deserts; Ulanqab&amp;rsquo;s Ulan Hada volcano was a close contender for this trip. But for a true desert experience, you have to head west. The four westernmost prefecture-level cities—Alxa, Bayannur, Wuhai, and Ordos—are the premier choices for desert adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1-arriving-in-bayannur"&gt;Day 1: Arriving in Bayannur
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/b9942f8ed5646d12c41cf37f86f1923e.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flew from Hangzhou to Bayannur with a transfer in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/1da0430dcdfa4488315a94e5bab61938.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight from Beijing to Bayannur offered views of complex mountain terrain, likely over the Shanxi area if I recall correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ccc8a7f3ac02941681798e2478780060.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mongolian, Bayannur means &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; (Bayan) &amp;ldquo;lake&amp;rdquo; (Nuur). As you travel through Inner Mongolia, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter &amp;ldquo;Bayan&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Nuur&amp;rdquo; frequently in place names. Other common Mongolian terms in place names include Hot (city), Gol (river), and Ulan (red), appearing in various combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayannur is often shortened to &amp;ldquo;Ba League,&amp;rdquo; where &amp;ldquo;League&amp;rdquo; (盟) is an administrative division equivalent to a prefecture-level city. On your travels, you&amp;rsquo;ll also see many &amp;ldquo;Banners&amp;rdquo; (旗), such as Alxa Left Banner and Urat Rear Banner, which correspond to county-level cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/48a04f056d37bc828c028715074e4d95.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up the rental car at the airport. It&amp;rsquo;s been years since my last car rental trip, and I was surprised to find the process is now fully automated. You inspect the vehicle and unlock it all through your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my first road trip in Inner Mongolia, the bilingual road signs immediately caught my eye. Nearly every Chinese character was accompanied by Mongolian script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/a40dbcf45299854e18f7c99052f301fc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner Mongolia uses the traditional Uyghur-style Mongolian script, an older form that resembles braided hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/d7cecf7096a7572101e8aec8ecc2d483.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is completely different from the Phags-pa script promoted by Kublai Khan, which was influenced by the Tibetan alphabet but is no longer a living language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/b029c7a8a303c2f66e395c428c123e50.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the nation of Mongolia, due to influence from the former Soviet Union, adopted the Cyrillic alphabet (essentially Russian letters) for writing Mongolian. In recent years, there has been a push to revive the traditional script, and now both are used officially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t speak Mongolian, but after observing the script for a few days, I noticed a pattern. The number of characters doesn&amp;rsquo;t always match the Chinese. For proper nouns like place names, the Mongolian is often one long, continuous &amp;ldquo;braid,&amp;rdquo; regardless of the number of Chinese characters. However, for modern concepts like &amp;ldquo;County Government,&amp;rdquo; the word counts often align. I suspect these modern terms were phonetically transliterated from Chinese, creating this discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if my theory holds water; I&amp;rsquo;d love for any Mongolian-speaking friends to shed some light on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the journey. We checked into our hotel in Ba League that night. I had been picturing a city the size of Dunhuang, but as we drove into the urban area, I realized they were in different leagues entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang is a remote county-level city under Jiuquan&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction. While famous for tourism, its scale and population are no match for the prefecture-level city of Bayannur. Ba League is filled with residential buildings over 20 stories high, generally taller than those in Hangzhou, giving it a vibe similar to cities in Guangdong or Fujian. A quick search showed Ba League has a population of 1.5 million, compared to Hangzhou&amp;rsquo;s roughly 10 million. That&amp;rsquo;s a considerable size for a non-provincial capital in the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2-ulan-buh-desert-sea-lake"&gt;Day 2: Ulan Buh Desert Sea Lake
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adventure officially began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ulan Buh Desert Sea Lake is a very niche, off-the-radar spot. When we arrived, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell it was a national holiday. The low ticket price is a dead giveaway that this place is more for locals than tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/a3f3cdb5875b2e5290f4b4e0880e4f76.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulan Buh Desert Sea Lake lies at the foot of the Yin Mountains, that faint range you see in the distance—yes, the same ones from the famous ancient poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenic area has two parts. You first arrive at a lake area with various water and sand activities, mostly involving boats and vehicles, plus the obligatory camel rides. For my daughter, having sand, water, and camels was a perfect day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/55cac54a3c20b9a5cbd059edb5d4c6e1.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long ride on a desert bus takes you into the desert proper. This is where the real magic happens, deep in the Ulan Buh Desert. It was an experience that even the more popular spots later in the trip couldn&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/c016fee0c1284624c53480beffd752aa.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area has fewer activities: sandboarding, archery, and go-karts. From the top of the sandboarding dune, you get a stunning panoramic view of the Ulan Buh Desert. Sandboarding is unlimited—sleds are scattered at the bottom for you to grab and use as you please. The go-karts are also a blast; I highly recommend a couple of laps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spot is on the way from Ba League to the Western Dream Canyon, so logically, it&amp;rsquo;s best to visit it en route to avoid backtracking. However, it takes a long time to fully enjoy, making it difficult to fit into a single day with other destinations, and there aren&amp;rsquo;t many good hotels nearby. I&amp;rsquo;d suggest skipping it if you&amp;rsquo;re traveling without kids or with older children, as Wuhai Lake offers a similar and more comprehensive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this day was all about my daughter&amp;rsquo;s fun in the sand. Other sights could wait. We left just before sunset and headed back to Ba League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/5b8c93513f8137a527ff66520e3bf74e.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive back was scenic, with lush vegetation, small villages, and vast fields of reeds and sunflowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suburbs here in the Hetao Plain are vastly different from those around Dunhuang. Dunhuang is surrounded by arid land with almost no agriculture. Here, thanks to the Yellow River, the plain is one of China&amp;rsquo;s key agricultural hubs. The villages we passed were all business, with shops selling seeds and offering farm equipment repair. Unlike rural areas in southern China, you won&amp;rsquo;t find &amp;ldquo;agritainment&amp;rdquo; or leisure farms here; everything is dedicated to supporting agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3-yin-mountains-drive--western-dream-canyon"&gt;Day 3: Yin Mountains Drive &amp;amp; Western Dream Canyon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was our longest day on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/5e441f44ecb93d8bcbd69844e48a3aa5.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set off from Ba League and drove towards the Yin Mountains again. From this day forward, the weather turned overcast, adding a stark, desolate beauty to the landscape, though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/8b1039bb6cf04093763fe81e47cd1d1c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed Ulan Buh Desert Sea Lake once more. The hazy air finally cleared as we reached the foot of the Yin Mountains, revealing their true form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove along the southern foothills, which are quite steep. The northern slope, by contrast, is much gentler, gradually merging into the Inner Mongolian Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yin Mountains are a significant climatic divide, but in a counter-intuitive way. One would assume the sunny southern slope, which also gets the summer monsoon winds, would be more verdant. However, in this arid region, it&amp;rsquo;s not about how much moisture you get, but how much you can keep. The southern slope&amp;rsquo;s intense sun exposure causes rapid evaporation, while the shaded, cooler northern slope retains more moisture, supporting lush alpine grasslands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to imagine a completely different world thriving just behind these barren-looking peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/6573be010408f199105fbc92320ef738.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent most of the day driving along the base of the mountains, the reddish-brown range weaving in and out of view. I put on a Xu Wei playlist I’d prepared, and the vibe was just incredible—an experience I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ddd5f50c58a452480ed73aa0458c6859.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was Jilu Fort, said to be where the famous Han dynasty lady-in-waiting, Wang Zhaojun, passed through on her way to marry a nomadic chieftain. This photo shows the landscape along the highway nearby, where you can see the varied colors and compositions of the Yin Mountains&amp;rsquo; rock and soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t actually make it into the site, though, due to a small mishap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jilu Fort also serves as the base camp for an off-road event. But the navigation app didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to care, routing me as if I were in a 4x4. Things got sketchy fast—the path was leading us into a creek bed, which our standard sedan couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to turn off the navigation and try to find the way myself by following tire tracks. My reward? Getting stuck in a seemingly harmless patch of sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/6a6ffce2c52575413b6cfbaf371efba2.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we were rescued an hour later, it was too late to visit. We took a closer look at the mountains and got back on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed A&amp;rsquo;gui Temple and the Yin Mountain Rock Paintings without stopping, heading straight for our main destination: the Western Dream Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/570ab74733bd8b926883e07b6e11a6ea.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the road lay a desert at the foot of the Yin Mountains. Despite the low-lying shrubs, the colors were astonishingly rich: various shades of green, yellow, orange, pink, and burgundy, all set against the white of the salt flats. It was as vibrant as any autumn forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/a51d0905c83681d61f4297ed7e42cf21.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the Western Dream Canyon, a stunning Yardang landform carved by wind erosion. We had now officially entered Alxa League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spot was more popular, with more tourists, but it still didn&amp;rsquo;t feel crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area has three routes. The central path is the core attraction, where you drive a short distance before walking or taking a shuttle for an up-close look at the canyon. The left and right routes are full self-driving loops with scenery that&amp;rsquo;s grander in scale but a bit more monotonous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/9b1bb22d03329dfca7cf70f45734dde2.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-hand route climbs to a high plateau offering a wide-open view of a wind farm deep within the mountains. From here, you can clearly see the different colored rock layers of the Yin Mountains; only the deep red sandstone has been sculpted into canyons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our visit, we had another two-hour-plus drive to the city of Wuhai. This stretch was also spectacular. Before hitting the expressway, we drove a long road that cut straight through the Ulan Buh Desert, flanked by endless yellow sand and occasional, massive solar farms. Many of these roads were unnamed on the map, and one was simply called the &amp;ldquo;Desert-Crossing Highway.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4-wuhai-lake"&gt;Day 4: Wuhai Lake
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wuhai Lake was a highlight of our trip, and the city of Wuhai itself left a fantastic impression. It was another day dedicated to playing in the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ea7925f5164483797195d0e62766d7fd.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at a map, it&amp;rsquo;s surprising to find a city as compact as Wuhai in the vast expanse of Inner Mongolia. But its modern streets, towering skyscrapers, and &amp;ldquo;Meng C&amp;rdquo; license plate (indicating its importance) suggest this city is something special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of research revealed its history as a classic resource-based city, built on coal. Wuhai was formed by merging two areas, Wuda and Haibowan, which originally belonged to different leagues. Due to the rich coal deposits, both areas were elevated to city status before being combined into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/5a76b77a83e8382dedae44b15e6c139c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wuhai&amp;rsquo;s centerpiece, Wuhai Lake, is a marvel in itself. It was created by diverting water from the Yellow River into the Ulan Buh Desert, forming a massive man-made lake. The Yellow River flows into the lake from the south and exits from the north to continue its journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The east bank of the lake is home to the city and a free public riverside park where the tour boat docks are located. The west bank is the Wuhai Lake Scenic Area, which features a unique &amp;ldquo;thousand-island lake&amp;rdquo; landscape in the desert, accessible only by boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a national holiday, we waited in line for the boat for at least 40 minutes. However, the city had thoughtfully arranged for a live band and a clown to entertain the queue, who even interacted with tourists, asking where they were from. It was a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening in, I realized nearly everyone was from neighboring provinces—Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang—with a few from the northeast. I overheard one family from Shanghai, which, along with our family from Zhejiang, made us the only two from the south. It seems Wuhai isn&amp;rsquo;t quite a top-tier national tourist destination yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we disembarked, we were in the main activity area. The crowd from the boat quickly dispersed across the vast space, and it suddenly felt spacious again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole place felt like an upgraded version of Ulan Buh Desert Sea Lake. With huge expanses of both water and sand, the variety of activities is immense, surpassing even Dunhuang&amp;rsquo;s Mingsha Mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s a paradise for adventure seekers, with dune buggies, desert off-roading, helicopters, and speedboats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much for my young daughter to do, though. We took a sightseeing shuttle to the far side of the dunes to walk along the famous desert highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/44ee8af00d352ef83b4bcdb03b8fa744.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfectly straight road cutting through the desert, pointing like a sword towards the distant city skyline and mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/8f6c8dca0d54cdcbf53068d1a6b00a1a.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing a dune beside the road, the view towards the city was a stunning tapestry of layers: sand dunes, the lake, reed marshes, city skyscrapers, and Gande&amp;rsquo;er Mountain, creating five distinct horizontal lines. The human-like figure on the mountain peak is a colossal statue of Genghis Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenery here is highly dependent on the weather; overcast skies don&amp;rsquo;t do it justice. But on a clear day, it must be breathtaking—the online photos are no exaggeration. Spring or summer might be the best times to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a phone photographer like me who sticks to auto mode, sunny weather is crucial in Wuhai. On a clear day, the lake reflects a brilliant blue sky. The contrast between that saturated blue and the yellow sand makes phone cameras produce incredibly vibrant photos. On an overcast day without any strong colors, the photos turn out flat and gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/7d00924c8ae2bc33c6157edf1e1d5456.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the top-right photo, for example. The bright red of the lighthouse and the blue of the floating bridge gave the camera&amp;rsquo;s algorithm enough color information to better capture what I saw, even rendering the sky&amp;rsquo;s gradient with more subtlety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the desert highway, we took a monster-wheeled truck to the lakeside to ride an amphibious vehicle. It was a gentle ride, and I even let my daughter drive the whole way. She&amp;rsquo;s had plenty of practice with kiddy cars at amusement parks and handled it like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We parked the vehicle and took a bamboo raft back to the main activity area. By then, the park was closing, and a light rain had started to fall. We took a quick camel ride before catching the boat back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/6d98b4ea2845aa13d49cfe0095d718bc.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wuhai Lake is a gathering place for countless red-billed gulls. They followed our boat on both trips, flying so close you felt you could almost touch them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our original plan for the evening was to drive to Shizuishan in Ningxia, to be closer to Shahu Lake, our next day&amp;rsquo;s destination. But given that Shahu Lake is similar to Wuhai Lake and we had spent a full, satisfying day here, we made a last-minute decision to stay another night in Wuhai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5-shitanjing-town--yinchuan"&gt;Day 5: Shitanjing Town &amp;amp; Yinchuan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we were skipping Shizuishan and Shahu Lake, we picked an alternative from our list: the small town of Shitanjing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/0874d53ae0633863b788908ce9dc224b.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner Mongolia truly lives up to its reputation as a wind power giant. The resources are abundant. Leaving Wuhai, we were constantly flanked by wind turbines; this was the closest we&amp;rsquo;d ever been to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shitanjing Town is tucked deep in the Helan Mountains, on the road between Shizuishan and Yinchuan, and falls within Shizuishan&amp;rsquo;s administrative area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shizuishan is a bit like Wuhai. The two cities are neighbors, share similar natural resources, and were both elevated from counties to cities because of the coal industry. If Wuhai is Inner Mongolia&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;coal pearl,&amp;rdquo; Shizuishan is Ningxia&amp;rsquo;s industrial engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/c3807dbac481d3bb52f5d424cdeff167.webp"

&lt;p&gt;Shitanjing was once a booming coal mining base. Now, with its high-quality coal resources depleted, it has been repurposed as a film set. Its well-preserved 1960s architecture tells the story of that industrious era.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town is tiny, just two intersecting streets. But this was once the bustling market for coal workers who came from all corners of the country, a place that added a little spice to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/8d7f92a1f2d06708ac653aea227c0a14.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still businesses operating today, but now they serve tourists. With fewer than five restaurants, a handful of souvenir stalls, a couple of general stores, and a small exhibition hall, that&amp;rsquo;s the extent of it. The rest of the town is made up of empty, old buildings. On the outskirts, a few modern structures suggest some local industry still exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/1cf0f231fb8103e17e27f858fb488b0f.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kilometer away stand the abandoned miners&amp;rsquo; dormitories, their windows now just dark, glassy voids. In the distance, the Helan Mountains stretch on endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/cf10f88d9290ae24074d4f988e743402.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a film town, it has been the backdrop for many realist dramas. The only one I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is &amp;ldquo;Minning Town.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/6f9841345901d0420a6dc1530cd9f53c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the show&amp;rsquo;s filming locations, though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t for the life of me recognize the scene. The dilapidated houses resemble those in Yongquan Village. If this was indeed the setting, then the desert reclamation efforts over the years have been incredibly successful—the village in the show was completely barren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ffa4194406280cf5c212d0511cf72444.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Shitanjing, we drove a long stretch through the Helan Mountains. The rock layers, twisted by tectonic forces, have left wavy patterns etched into the mountainsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/1eb015af61c52b8005076c8ad4eedec8.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Helan Mountains have many of these black rock strata. We also saw several active coal mines along the way, leading me to believe these black layers are rich in coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we left the mountains, we hit the expressway to Yinchuan. The desert and Gobi landscapes vanished completely, replaced by lush, green plains on both sides of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This journey had taken us through a symphony of landscapes: farmland, Gobi, desert, the Yellow River, mountains, and plains. The scenery was ever-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/0d3a7ee8be581f4e1c496e86c12adde6.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Yinchuan, checked into our hotel, and headed out for dinner. Afterwards, we stumbled upon a National Day drone show during our walk. We were watching from behind, so all the images were mirrored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/a0b7efacaa3a33c013d79baba421ffdc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s a public holiday. Why are you showing me &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ba1a13f7cbdbd244335feedbbd4a04bf.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our walk took us to Yinchuan&amp;rsquo;s Drum Tower and the central pedestrian street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the Drum Tower brought back a wave of memories from my &lt;a class="link" href="https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Beijing trip&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago. It was the same season, the same temperature, another post-dinner stroll, and the architecture was strikingly similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/f46e4d0571ee0d77c246d9e5509c10fc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pedestrian street was packed. We decided not to brave the crowds, grabbed a few bottles of fresh milk, and taxied back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6-the-journey-home"&gt;Day 6: The Journey Home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t plan any activities for our last day. Since the hotel didn&amp;rsquo;t offer breakfast anyway, we all slept in, filled up the car, returned it, and caught our flight back to Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why we drove to Yinchuan for our flight after visiting Shitanjing. The simple reason is that as a provincial capital, Yinchuan has direct flights. Flying from Shizuishan or Wuhai would have meant a layover of at least 1.5 hours. I&amp;rsquo;d much rather spend that time driving than sitting in an airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="trip-tidbits"&gt;Trip Tidbits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="transportation"&gt;Transportation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was our first multi-city road trip with our daughter, covering about 400-500 kilometers. Thankfully, careful planning ensured each leg of the drive was under two hours, which was manageable for her and not too exhausting for me. One thing&amp;rsquo;s for sure: next time, I&amp;rsquo;m renting a car with cruise control. Manually maintaining speed is a real workout for your foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attractions on this route are generally quite far from urban centers. Aside from Wuhai Lake, which is right in the city, most places were at least an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive from the nearest town. And since kids have no concept of time, we rarely hit the road before 11 a.m. This meant lunch was usually packed snacks or a big hotel breakfast that doubled as brunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="weather"&gt;Weather
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the National Day holiday, daytime temperatures in Ba League were a pleasant 20-25°C, with nights around 10°C. However, starting from our arrival in Wuhai, the weather turned overcast and chilly, with daytime highs dropping to around 15°C. It even rained on our last day in Yinchuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="food--accommodation"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Accommodation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about food. I&amp;rsquo;d read in travel guides that you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with beef and mutton in Inner Mongolia and Ningxia, and my experience confirmed it. Every meal was delicious. Even the hand-pulled mutton at the Yinchuan airport was so good we ordered a second large plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the streets of Ba League had more shops selling duck necks and feet than mutton restaurants. A chain called &amp;ldquo;Lonely Duck&amp;rdquo; was as common as convenience stores. When I asked a local about it, she said, &amp;ldquo;We cook mutton at home all the time, so why would we go out for it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This local lady from Ba League gave us two excellent recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laoniutou: A tiny, hard-to-find shop near a fire station that sells beef jerky. She insisted we buy the fresh jerky sold by weight, not the pre-packaged kind, and mentioned she buys it herself regularly. We got half a kilogram, and the rich, beefy flavor was so addictive we snacked on it throughout the trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laoyangguan: A mutton hotpot restaurant just a few hundred meters from Laoniutou. We went there the night we got back from Ulan Buh Desert Sea Lake. We skipped the hotpot and ordered the hand-pulled mutton. The quality of the meat was superb; such a simple preparation was all it needed to be amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have to recommend the Bolinhan Hotel in Wuhai. We booked it last minute when we decided to stay an extra night, and it turned out to be the best hotel of our entire trip, despite not being the most expensive. The bedding, amenities, and breakfast were all top-notch. The breakfast spread was fantastic, and the restaurant staff were incredibly warm and welcoming. It&amp;rsquo;s where I first tried savory Mongolian milk tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next door to the hotel is Yanyun Casserole, a restaurant owned by the same hotel group. Trusting our &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t-go-wrong-with-mutton&amp;rdquo; motto, we tried the radish &amp;amp; mutton casserole and the yellow tomato &amp;amp; beef casserole. Both were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also kept encountering a local cold dish made primarily with bean sprouts. I found it delicious and refreshing and had it at several different restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, our days consisted of a big breakfast and snacks for lunch, followed by a mutton feast for dinner every single night. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough mutton to last me the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="trip-expenses"&gt;Trip Expenses
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vast and sparsely populated northwest, transportation is the biggest cost. Airfare took the largest chunk, followed by the car rental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/96fad7c0a09a2ec6e2f2935ea2363823.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, two desert trips in just over a month have left me with plenty of memories to savor for a long time. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a change of pace for our next adventure. A beach island? A tropical rainforest? A winter wonderland?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows? It&amp;rsquo;s the suspense that makes for a great surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>蒙西宁夏国庆小众自驾6天5夜</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/inner-mongolia-north-ningxia-self-driving-tour/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/inner-mongolia-north-ningxia-self-driving-tour/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/8f6c8dca0d54cdcbf53068d1a6b00a1a.webp" alt="Featured image of post 蒙西宁夏国庆小众自驾6天5夜" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;继上个月&lt;a class="link" href="https://victor42.eth.limo/post/a-revisit-to-dunhuang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;敦煌遛娃&lt;/a&gt;后，女儿彻底爱上大沙漠，回来成天嚷嚷我还要去月牙泉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没问题，安排！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，国庆游沙漠，得避开沙坡头、响沙湾这样的热门景点。一番研究后，锁定一条相对小众的线路：巴彦淖尔——阿拉善——乌海——石嘴山——银川。一路自驾过去，导航路况全程绿色。景点人也不算多，2天玩沙，2天看景，体验到了与敦煌不同的沙漠戈壁风貌，反向旅游很成功。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/edb00e149254372e350a5e9496f2847c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这条路线大部分在内蒙古西部，一小段在宁夏北部。路线大体上沿着黄河前进，属于河套平原的西段。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/534742728de3caa908bc33605f12525d.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;内蒙古东西跨度很大，自然景观丰富。东部有呼伦贝尔大草原，但纬度比哈尔滨还北，10月已入冬，草原变黄冻成狗。中部有草原有沙漠，值得一提的是乌兰察布的乌兰哈达火山，此行差点选了那里。但想要玩沙漠，必须来蒙西，最西端4个地级市阿拉善、巴彦淖尔、乌海、鄂尔多斯是内蒙玩沙首选。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第1天落地巴彦淖尔"&gt;第1天：落地巴彦淖尔
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/b9942f8ed5646d12c41cf37f86f1923e.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;杭州出发，在北京转机，前往巴彦淖尔。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/1da0430dcdfa4488315a94e5bab61938.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;北京到巴彦淖尔这一程，沿途可见复杂的山地景观。没记错的话，这应该是在山西一带。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ccc8a7f3ac02941681798e2478780060.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;巴彦淖尔在蒙语中的意思是富饶（巴彦）的湖泊（淖尔）。如果去内蒙的其他地方旅行，也会在地名里分别见到“巴彦”和“淖尔”。蒙语常见的地名词还有浩特（城市）、郭勒（河流）、乌兰（红色），各种排列组合。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;巴彦淖尔简称巴盟，“盟”在内蒙相当于地级市。旅行途中还会发现大量的“旗”，阿拉善左旗、乌拉特后旗，旗对应的县级市。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/48a04f056d37bc828c028715074e4d95.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在机场取车。许多年没有租车旅行了，原来现在取车还车都实现了无人化。手机操作验车、开车门，确认后就可以用了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;初到内蒙古自驾，最先注意到的是蒙汉双语路牌，几乎所有汉字旁都注有蒙文。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/a40dbcf45299854e18f7c99052f301fc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;内蒙古使用的是回鹘式蒙文，是一种相对古老的蒙文，看起来像麻花辫。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/d7cecf7096a7572101e8aec8ecc2d483.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;元世祖忽必烈推行的八思巴蒙文又完全不同，是一种受藏文字母影响的文字。但这已经不是一种活着的语言了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/b029c7a8a303c2f66e395c428c123e50.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而蒙古国在近代受前苏联影响，甚至一度使用西里尔字母书写蒙文，其实就是俄文字母。近些年蒙古国在恢复使用传统回鹘式蒙文，两种都作为官方文字使用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我不懂蒙文，仔细观察这些麻花辫几天后，发现它和汉语的字数不总是对应的，但有一定的规律。比如地名等固有名词，不论汉语几个字，蒙语就一根麻花辫。但涉及到许多近现代概念，蒙文和汉语的字数往往是一致的，比如“县政府”。我猜这些近现代概念是从汉语里通过音译的方式进入蒙语的，所以造成了这个局面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不知道猜测是否正确，希望懂蒙语的朋友科普一下。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;言归正传，当晚我们入住巴盟。来之前我总是以敦煌的城市规模来想象巴盟，开进市区才发现两者完全不是量级的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌是酒泉市下属的一个偏远县级市，尽管文旅名气大，但城市规模、人口完全无法和地级市巴彦淖尔相提并论。巴盟市内随处可见20层以上的居民楼，比杭州的居民楼普遍还高，有一种广东福建的感觉。一查才知道，巴盟有150万人口，作为对比杭州大约1000万。对一个北方非省会城市而言，这规模可一点也不小。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第2天乌兰布和沙海湖"&gt;第2天：乌兰布和沙海湖
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;正式踏上旅途。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个乌兰布和沙海湖景区，其实是一个非常小众的市郊景点，我们到时完全感觉不到是国庆假期。从门票价格你就能看出来，这种景点不是给外地人准备的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/a3f3cdb5875b2e5290f4b4e0880e4f76.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;乌兰布和沙海湖位于阴山脚下，就是远处隐隐约约的山脉，“不教胡马度阴山”那个阴山。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;景区分2部分，首先会来到湖泊区，这里有一个小湖和一些水上和沙地游乐项目，车船为主，当然也少不了骑骆驼。对于女儿来说，有沙有水，还有骆驼，就够她玩一天了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/55cac54a3c20b9a5cbd059edb5d4c6e1.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;乘沙漠巴士走一段很长的沙路，来到沙漠区。这是真正精彩的地方，深入乌兰布和沙漠腹地。这种体验甚至在后几天更热门的景点都没有。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/c016fee0c1284624c53480beffd752aa.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个区域游玩项目不多，有滑沙、射箭、自驾卡丁车。爬上滑沙的沙丘，可以远眺乌兰布和沙漠。滑沙没有次数限制，大量滑沙板就放在地上，自助上山，自助滑沙。自驾卡丁车也很刺激，推荐来两圈。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;乌兰布和沙海湖在巴盟到西部梦幻峡谷的路线上，按理说一天内一路玩过去最合适，避免走回头路。但这个景点游玩时间很长，去了就无法在一天内走完整个路线，沿途也没有条件较好的酒店。对于不带小孩或孩子比较大的游客，建议略过。这里的大部分精彩，在乌海湖也能体验。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，这一天是专为女儿规划的，主题是玩沙。其他地方次日再去。太阳落山前，离开景点，返回巴盟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/5b8c93513f8137a527ff66520e3bf74e.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沿途植被繁茂，散落着小村庄，随处可见芦苇荡和向日葵田。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;河套平原的城郊和敦煌的城郊有很大区别。敦煌周边几乎没有农业，而得益于黄河，河套平原成为我国重要的粮仓。路过的小村庄，沿街商铺全是种子、农机维修等。也不像南方的农村，总有些农家乐旅游休闲项目，这里完完全全是为第一产业服务的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第3天阴山自驾与西部梦幻峡谷"&gt;第3天：阴山自驾与西部梦幻峡谷
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;里程最长的一天。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/5e441f44ecb93d8bcbd69844e48a3aa5.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从巴盟出发，再次向阴山驶去。从这一天开始，旅途全程都是阴天，增添了一些苍凉氛围，但不太利于拍照。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/8b1039bb6cf04093763fe81e47cd1d1c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;又路过了乌兰布和沙海湖，继续开到阴山脚下时，才摆脱那种雾蒙蒙的感觉，看清它的真正面貌。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们是沿着阴山南麓前行，比较陡峭。而北坡则平缓得多，逐渐过渡到内蒙古高原。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阴山在地理上是一条重要的气候分界线，但非常反直觉。通常情况，我们会觉得山的南坡向阳，夏季又有东南季风，植被生长会更好。但在降水稀少的地区，关键不是哪边输入的水分多，而是哪边能留住更多水分。山南由于日照高温水分蒸发快，而北坡背阴低温保持了更多水分，反而孕育一片郁郁葱葱的高山草原。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想象一下，这贫瘠的群山背后，是一个截然不同的世界，也是很有意思。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/6573be010408f199105fbc92320ef738.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大半天都沿着阴山脚下行驶，红褐色的山脉忽远忽近。连上车机，播放提前准备的许巍歌单，非常上头，此生难忘。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ddd5f50c58a452480ed73aa0458c6859.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沿途第一个景点，鸡鹿塞，据传是昭君出塞的地方。这是附近公路沿线的景观，可以看到阴山的岩石土壤有好几种不同的成分，颜色差异很大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但这个景点我们并没有真正进去，遇到了点小状况。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;鸡鹿塞同时是“渡·阴山”越野自驾大本营。开到这时，导航软件可不管那么多，完全按越野车的车况给我导了。越开越不对劲，都要溯溪了，我们这普通的公路车可吃不消。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;只好关掉导航自己找路，沿着别人的车辙尝试开到景点，结果就陷在一滩不起眼的沙里了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/6a6ffce2c52575413b6cfbaf371efba2.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个多小时后救援脱险，已经来不及进去参观了。近距离看了看阴山，继续上路。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;接下来还经过了阿贵庙、阴山岩画，都没有停下，直奔这天的主要目的地：西部梦幻峡谷。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/570ab74733bd8b926883e07b6e11a6ea.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公路另一侧，阴山脚下的沙漠。别看都是低矮的沙漠植物，颜色却出奇丰富。可以看到不同深浅的绿，还有黄、橙、粉、酒红，加上盐碱地的白，真不亚于秋季的森林。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/a51d0905c83681d61f4297ed7e42cf21.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;抵达西部梦幻峡谷，雅丹地貌，风蚀而成的峡谷。至此已进入阿拉善盟的范围。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是个相对热门的景点，游客多起来了，但没到拥挤的程度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;景区3条路，中间是最核心的区域。驾车一小段，然后步行或乘观光车，近距离观赏峡谷风貌。左右2条路是全程自驾，两边的峡谷风景相较于中间单调一些，但体积更为宏大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/9b1bb22d03329dfca7cf70f45734dde2.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;左边自驾道路会经过一段高地，视野开阔，可见阴山深处的风电场。在这里能明显看到阴山的多种山体颜色，被风蚀形成峡谷的，只有那种深红色沙石。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;游玩结束，再行驶2个多小时前往乌海市。这一程也非常精彩，上高速前，有很长一段都在乌兰布和沙漠里穿行，两侧是漫漫黄沙，偶尔还能看到大片的光伏阵列。许多路段在导航上都是无名路，其中还有一条就叫“穿沙公路”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第4天乌海湖"&gt;第4天：乌海湖
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;乌海湖是此行的重点，乌海市给我留下的印象也非常不错。又是玩沙的一天。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ea7925f5164483797195d0e62766d7fd.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;观察地图发现，辽阔的内蒙古竟然有乌海这样一个袖珍地级市。但是看它现代化的街道、高楼林立的城市景观，以及蒙C车牌，怎么看都觉得这个城市不简单。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;查了一下这个城市的历史，它是典型的因矿设市的资源型城市。乌海原本由乌达和海勃湾两个区域构成，两地分属两个不同的盟。但由于此地煤矿资源丰富，两个盟分别把它们提升为独立城市，后再经统一合并而成。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/5a76b77a83e8382dedae44b15e6c139c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;乌海市的核心景观乌海湖，也是一个神奇的存在。把黄河水引入乌兰布和沙漠，形成了一个巨大的湖泊。黄河水从南端流进乌海湖，再从北端出去，继续它的旅程。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;湖泊东岸是市区，也是免费的市民沿河公园，游船码头在这里。湖泊西岸是乌海湖景区，有独特的沙漠千岛湖景观，必须乘船才能抵达。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;国庆原因，码头排队等了至少40分钟。但队伍旁边安排了乐队演唱和小丑表演，还时不时和队伍中的游客互动，问大家来自哪里。足见乌海市的诚意。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;听下来发现几乎都是邻省，宁夏的陕西的甘肃的新疆的，偶有东北的。听到一家来自上海的，再加上我们这家来自浙江的，唯二的南方家庭。如此看来，乌海在全国来说的确不算很热门的旅游目的地。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上岸直接就是游乐区，排队的游客在广阔的景区里散开，忽然又觉得不挤了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这整个景区给我感觉是乌兰布和沙海湖的升级版。​由于同时有大面积水和沙，这里的游乐项目种类非常多，甚至都不是敦煌鸣沙山可比。尤以各种车船冒险为主，要想刺激的话巴吉赛车、越野冲沙、直升机、快艇都有。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过女儿能玩的不多。我们先乘坐观光车，绕到沙丘后方走走那条网红沙漠公路。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/44ee8af00d352ef83b4bcdb03b8fa744.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沙漠当中笔直一条公路，剑一般直指远方城市高楼和山脉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/8f6c8dca0d54cdcbf53068d1a6b00a1a.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;爬上公路边的沙丘，往市区方向望去，是层次极其丰富的景观。沙丘、湖泊、芦苇荡、城市高楼、甘德尔山，共同构成5层水平线。甘德尔山峰顶那个人形物体，是一尊巨大的成吉思汗像。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里就是比较依赖天气，阴天不那么出片。但可以想象晴天时的风光，网上的攻略绝不是照骗。可能春夏季来风景更好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;像我这种用手机拍照且只用自动模式的人，尤其要趁晴天来乌海。天气晴朗时低角度拍摄，乌海湖面会反射湛蓝的天空，那种高饱和蓝和黄沙的冲撞，会使得手机的相机算法拍出色彩非常饱满的照片。而如果阴天里，画面又没有任何一种足够鲜艳的颜色，照片的对比度和饱和度就会非常低，一切都灰蒙蒙的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/7d00924c8ae2bc33c6157edf1e1d5456.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就比如右上这张照片，由于灯塔鲜艳红色和蓝色浮桥的存在，相机算法才得以较好还原肉眼所见的效果，天空的颜色过渡都变得细腻了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;逛完沙漠公路，乘坐轮子巨大的大脚车来到湖边，这里有水陆两栖车，比较平缓。我甚至全程让女儿开，她平时游乐场小车没少玩，开得很老练。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;停好水陆两栖车，再乘竹筏回一开始的游乐区。这时景区也快下班了，甚至还下起了小雨。带女儿骑了一圈骆驼就乘船返回了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/6d98b4ea2845aa13d49cfe0095d718bc.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​乌海湖聚集了大量红嘴鸥，往返途中会一路追着游艇。飞得很近，似乎触手可及。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当晚原计划开车前往宁夏石嘴山市，离次日要玩的沙湖景区更近一些。但考虑到沙湖和乌海湖性质接近，且在乌海湖玩得尽兴很晚才离去，临时改变计划在乌海多住一晚。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第5天石炭井小镇与银川"&gt;第5天：石炭井小镇与银川
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;既然略过石嘴山市，也不去沙湖景区，就从备选景点里找了一个石炭井小镇玩玩。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/0874d53ae0633863b788908ce9dc224b.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;内蒙不愧是风电大省，风力资源丰富。离开乌海路上，沿途经常看见风机，这是我们离风力发电机最近的一次。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;石炭井小镇位于贺兰山脉深处，在石嘴山市到银川的途中，属于石嘴山范围。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;石嘴山和乌海情况有点像，两者接壤，自然资源也相近，同样是因为煤炭工业撤县设市。乌海是内蒙的煤炭明珠，石嘴山是宁夏的工业担当。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/c3807dbac481d3bb52f5d424cdeff167.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;石炭井小镇，一个从前的煤炭开采基地。如今优质煤矿资源枯竭，已转型为一个影视基地。保存完好的60年代建筑，讲着那个奋进年代的故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/36c2ad368eee7589ac85764aec80b42e.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;小镇不大，横竖2条街。但这是当年从天南海北来的煤矿从业者的市集，是他们生活的调味瓶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/8d7f92a1f2d06708ac653aea227c0a14.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;小镇上今天都还有商业，但已经转而为游客服务了。不超过5家餐馆、少量纪念品小摊、几间杂货店、一个小展览馆，这就是小镇的全部，其余都是空置的老建筑。小镇外围还有少量现代建筑，可能是与当地现存产业相关的单位。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/1cf0f231fb8103e17e27f858fb488b0f.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;与小镇1公里遥遥相望的是矿区宿舍，如今已人去楼空，窗户全都没有玻璃，只剩漆黑的空洞。再远处就是绵延的贺兰山了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/cf10f88d9290ae24074d4f988e743402.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为影视小镇，这里拍摄了不少现实主义题材剧作，但其中我只看过《山海情》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/6f9841345901d0420a6dc1530cd9f53c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里就是山海情取景地之一，我实在没看出来是哪。和涌泉村的破房子有点像，如果真是那段场景，那这些年沙漠治理的也太好了，剧里的涌泉村可是一棵植物都没有。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ffa4194406280cf5c212d0511cf72444.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;离开石炭井，有很长一段路都在贺兰山里穿梭。岩层在地壳的挤压和拉扯下扭曲，在山体上留下波浪状纹理。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/1eb015af61c52b8005076c8ad4eedec8.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;贺兰山有大量这种黑色岩层，一路还看到不少仍在运转的煤矿场，我猜想这些黑色岩层应该含煤。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;离开贺兰山，开上了通往银川的高速。周遭已经完全看不到沙漠或戈壁了，道路两旁是郁郁葱葱的原野。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这趟旅程一路经过了农田、戈壁、沙漠、黄河、山脉、原野，风景千变万化，一部自然的交响曲。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/0d3a7ee8be581f4e1c496e86c12adde6.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;抵达银川市，酒店休整片刻出来吃晚饭。饭后散步偶遇国庆无人机秀，只不过我们观看角度在背后，画面是反的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/a0b7efacaa3a33c013d79baba421ffdc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是，这大放假的，你让我看这个是什么意思！？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/ba1a13f7cbdbd244335feedbbd4a04bf.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一路逛到了银川的鼓楼和市中心步行街。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看到这鼓楼，几年前那趟&lt;a class="link" href="https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;北京之行&lt;/a&gt;的记忆涌了上来。同样的季节，同样的气温，同样是晚饭后消食，建筑造型也非常相似。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/f46e4d0571ee0d77c246d9e5509c10fc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;步行街人头攒动，没进去凑这热闹，买了几瓶鲜牛奶便打车回酒店了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第6天返程"&gt;第6天：返程
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;最后一天没有安排游玩。刚好这酒店也不提供早餐，一家人睡个懒觉，加满油，还车，飞机回杭州。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;解释一下，为什么石炭井玩好了要跑来银川坐飞机呢？纯粹是因为省会城市有直飞航班。石嘴山或乌海回杭州，都要转机至少1个半小时。这时间与其在机场干坐着，不如换成一段自驾体验吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="游玩花絮"&gt;游玩花絮
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="交通"&gt;交通
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;这是第一次带女儿自驾辗转多城旅行，全程四五百公里。但好在提前规划推演过，确保每一段路途不超过2小时车程，女儿在车上待得住，我也不至于太累。只是下次租车一定得租个带定速巡航的，靠人控制车速实在太费脚了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这条路线的景点离城市普遍较远。除了乌海湖在市区，其余景点离最近的城市都至少1小时车程。小朋友又没有时间观念，每天真正出发上路都已经11点了。这导致中饭基本都要提前准备，吃不上热食，或者得把酒店早餐吃成早午餐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="天气"&gt;天气
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;关于天气，国庆期间巴盟白天温度20-25度，夜里也有10度左右。但从到乌海那天开始，阴天天气转冷，白天可能也只有15度左右了。最后离开银川时还下了场雨。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="餐饮住宿"&gt;餐饮住宿
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;饮食方面，那可就有的说道了。之前看别人攻略说，内蒙宁夏吃牛羊肉基本放心吃，去哪家都不会踩雷。亲身体验过，确实如此。甚至银川机场的手抓羊肉都好吃到我们另加了一盘大份。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;奇特的是，巴盟街头卖鸭脖鸭掌的店甚至比牛羊肉餐馆还多。有一家叫寂寞的鸭子简直和便利店一样普遍。问了问当地人，他们说羊肉自家经常做，谁还去外面吃？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这位巴盟大姐推荐了我们两家本地好店：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;老牛头是一家卖牛肉干的小店，小到难找，在消防站附近。大姐叮嘱我们要买新鲜称斤的，不要包装好的，她自己也经常买。我们来了一斤，牛肉味浓郁，一路吃得停不下来。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;佬羊倌是一家羊肉火锅店，离老牛头几百米。我们从乌兰布和沙海湖回来那晚去拔草了，没点火锅，点了手抓羊肉。羊肉食材好，简单的做法就足够惊艳。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还要推荐乌海的泊林瀚酒店。这是我们改变计划决定在乌海多住一晚临时找的，没想到是全程最满意的酒店，价格还不是最贵的。酒店的床品、设施、早餐都是此行最佳。尤其早餐品种丰富，餐厅阿姨也很热情。在这里喝到了咸口的蒙古奶茶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;酒店隔壁的焱云砂锅，是泊林瀚酒店集团旗下的餐饮品牌。本着牛羊肉随便吃不踩雷的精神，萝卜羊肉砂锅和黄柿子牛肉砂锅各来了一份，都很满意。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当地还常见一种以豆芽为主的凉拌菜，我觉得很下饭，在好几家店都吃到过。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总之，这几天都是中饭靠酒店早餐+小吃，晚饭顿顿羊肉。可能把我接下来好几个月的羊肉都吃了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="旅行开支"&gt;旅行开支
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;大西北地广人稀，大头还是交通。机票最多，其次是租车。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-10/96fad7c0a09a2ec6e2f2935ea2363823.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，一个多月内连续两趟沙漠行，足够回味很久了。下一次换换风格吧，沙滩海岛？热带雨林？冰雪世界？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;谁知道呢，有悬念才有惊喜。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dunhuang Revisited - A 5-Day Family Trip</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/a-revisit-to-dunhuang/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 00:28:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/a-revisit-to-dunhuang/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/f0f9c750741f37672e767b157114d821.webp" alt="Featured image of post Dunhuang Revisited - A 5-Day Family Trip" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been four years since my last visit, and my daughter is finally old enough for a proper long-distance trip. The goal was to introduce her to the desert and Gobi, a landscape starkly different from the lush mountains and rivers of southern China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling with a kid raises the bar for transport and lodging. We narrowed it down to three well-established desert destinations: Mingsha Mountain in Dunhuang, Shapotou in Ningxia, and Xiangshawan in Inner Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’d been to Dunhuang before and written a detailed travelogue about it: &lt;a class="link" href="https://victor42.eth.limo/post/en/3596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Dunhuang Self-Drive 5 Days 4 Nights&lt;/a&gt;, covering all the main attractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shapotou in Ningxia offers a unique combination of desert and the Yellow River.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiangshawan in Inner Mongolia is less scenic and more of a desert resort, but it&amp;rsquo;s commercially well-developed with plenty of attractions, including a water park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much discussion, my wife and I decided on a return trip to Dunhuang. Familiarity meant fewer potential pitfalls, plus we had a chance to visit the Yadan Geopark, which we missed last time. Having only been to the great Northwest once before, our decision to revisit the same city speaks volumes about its charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/359778400fcbf9e47d939b5ebe8fd488.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2025, there&amp;rsquo;s a single direct flight from Hangzhou to Dunhuang, which departs in the afternoon and arrives in the evening. It was my daughter&amp;rsquo;s first flight, and she was thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our itinerary dedicated the first and last days to travel, leaving us with three full days for exploring. We tackled the West Route to Yadan on day one, saving the next two for Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="west-thousand-buddha-caves"&gt;West Thousand Buddha Caves
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/b01193f7c43433b48dd387b9bd5bd768.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a stop along the West Route on our way to Yadan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous Mogao Grottoes are also known as the Thousand Buddha Caves and are located east of Dunhuang. To the west lies a similar, smaller complex: the West Thousand Buddha Caves. For the average tourist who has already seen Mogao, a visit here isn&amp;rsquo;t essential, which explains the tranquility and lack of crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/aa6631f13fae08babc0934f0a7c1ab68.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve visited Mogao before, and while our daughter is likely too young to appreciate the grottoes fully, giving her a quick glimpse was a good introduction. This place was perfect for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We joined a guided tour of four caves, where photography was forbidden. The statues here are more heavily damaged, but the murals are on par with those at Mogao. A few details were particularly striking and unique to this site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only tent-style grotto ceiling in all of Dunhuang, sloping down from a central beam in a nod to nomadic culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partially restored statues from the Republic of China era, offering a rare look at their inner construction: a wooden core wrapped in straw and coated with mud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A layered mural created by the Shazhou Uyghur regime. They whitewashed over original Sui and Tang dynasty frescoes to paint their own. Over the centuries, the whitewash has faded, allowing the older artwork to peek through, creating a fascinating overlap of two distinct artistic periods on a single wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other features, like the predominantly male-like appearance of Sui dynasty Buddhas and the distinct representations of disciples Ananda and Kasyapa, are also seen at Mogao and serve as valuable resources for studying ancient history and fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yadan-geopark"&gt;Yadan Geopark
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yadan is the final destination on the West Route, a road that literally ends there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/0ea22c19aefaca61c2d3de0f6301ddc4.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sight of Yadan is guaranteed to be awe-inspiring. Even for desert veterans, it&amp;rsquo;s an entirely new experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfectly flat terrain, the uniform horizontal textures of the yardang formations, and the vast, distant horizon combine to stretch one&amp;rsquo;s sense of space to the absolute limit. It&amp;rsquo;s a stunning display of order emerging from the chaos of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/436c397c22ad624676e3e139feeda3ea.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling is akin to gazing upon a sea of clouds from an airplane window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape&amp;rsquo;s formation is a story of natural order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/daea07d0c6be229f9d2c4823c66f8de1.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diagram from Yadan&amp;rsquo;s official website clearly illustrates its geological evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Middle Pleistocene (c. 300,000–100,000 years ago), this area was a freshwater lake that deposited perfectly level layers of soil. In the Late Pleistocene (c. 100,000–10,000 years ago), the land rose, the lake dried up, and the exposed layers were subjected to extreme temperature shifts. This, combined with persistent, powerful winds, began to carve the landscape much like water carves a canyon. The wind sculpted long, ridge-like yardangs, which were then further eroded into walls, towers, and pillars, destined to one day crumble back into dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yadan landscape is in a constant state of flux. What we see today is its geological prime. In tens of thousands of years, these magnificent structures will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sightseeing-bus"&gt;Sightseeing Bus
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first leg of the tour is a bus ride with stops at designated viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/2e1a98ff741f5c203985c8898fa598c1.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was a police station built right into a yardang—a relic from the area&amp;rsquo;s initial development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/aa63efde2305501258f317c59d2610a9.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the park&amp;rsquo;s yardangs have been named for things they resemble, the most striking being the &amp;ldquo;Peacock Standing Gracefully.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s remarkably lifelike. My daughter, however, was far more impressed by the swings at the rest stop, where we happily passed the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the formations we saw, the most spectacular has to be the &amp;ldquo;West Sea Fleet,&amp;rdquo; a vast and rare collection of massive, ridge-like yardangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/11e753d1361701b8a2c83e06e360004c.gif"

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a GIF to give you a sense of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vegetation is sparse here. Instead, black gravel acts as an anchor, securing the soil and protecting the landforms from wind erosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve sketched a rough map; the red line is the bus route. It&amp;rsquo;s high-res enough to save. Based on my observations, there are at least three types of off-road vehicle experiences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the &amp;ldquo;Peacock&amp;rdquo; stop, there&amp;rsquo;s an &amp;ldquo;Off-Road Vehicle Station.&amp;rdquo; We skipped this one. Staff explained it follows the main road but allows you to stop anywhere. I suspect it takes the small blue loop on the map during the return journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the start of the blue route, there&amp;rsquo;s another station where we rented a self-drive vehicle for ¥298. You can stop whenever you like but must stick to a designated gravel path. It&amp;rsquo;s a low-speed electric cart; the route takes about 20 minutes non-stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The electric cart route ends at the park&amp;rsquo;s prime sunset spot. Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll find more powerful off-roaders and boat-shaped &amp;ldquo;desert assault buses.&amp;rdquo; Staff said these could take you deep into the Gobi along the green route and back. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how far in they go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took our time on the electric vehicle route, stopping frequently for photos and a Hami melon snack on the Gobi, turning a 20-minute ride into a nearly two-hour adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former World of Warcraft players would surely appreciate my excitement, seeing landscapes reminiscent of The Barrens, Thousand Needles, and Shimmering Flats come to life. I felt an undeniable urge to just walk off into the deep Gobi alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the park names these formations after familiar objects—some fitting, some a stretch—I believe that if you strip away human projections, its raw, natural form is a masterpiece of pure beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mingsha-mountain--crescent-lake"&gt;Mingsha Mountain &amp;amp; Crescent Lake
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent the next two days at Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Lake, an ideal desert playground for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rare to find a desert attraction so conveniently close to a city in China. It offers all the wildness and romance of the desert, yet it&amp;rsquo;s only a ten-minute taxi ride from our hotel. The ticket is valid for three consecutive days of unlimited entry, and it&amp;rsquo;s even free for residents of nearby cities like Jiuquan and Jiayuguan (check the official account for current policies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/fccc1820a27b6dbd465ec60b495d8bd1.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park has several gates, but the central one is the main entrance where taxis drop you off. The view upon entering is shown above, but it&amp;rsquo;s even more stunning at sunset. The interplay of light and shadow gives the dunes a dramatic, three-dimensional quality. I have more photos in my &lt;a class="link" href="https://victor42.eth.limo/post/en/3596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;previous Dunhuang travelogue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is split into two zones. The East Zone is geared towards adventure and &amp;ldquo;conquering nature,&amp;rdquo; with paid activities like hot air balloons, off-roading, and paragliding. The West Zone evokes the romance of the ancient Western Regions, featuring the camel camp, Crescent Lake, and sightseeing carts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had done the East Zone activities on our last trip, and they&amp;rsquo;re mostly unsuitable for young children, so we headed straight for the west. Under the midday sun, we found a shaded spot by Crescent Lake for our daughter to play freely in the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/f0f9c750741f37672e767b157114d821.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite spots in the park. Just out of frame to the lower left is Crescent Lake. The shape, layers, and curving ridge of this particular dune are perfect, projecting a sense of solitary power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun began to dip, we started exploring. My daughter absolutely loved the camels and rode one each day. Time was the only thing stopping her from going for another round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/0a940b1061b67e4f782aac2acb7a5799.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited Crescent Lake and the Yuequan Pavilion on its shore. The small, lush courtyard feels wonderfully surreal set against the vast expanse of sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/59c6101ade7ddbf4e1ca7924ccc8a260.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the endless desert, this pristine little courtyard feels almost like a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/26c0cff2bbe85c78f5aaecde2d03f363.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a vantage point above, the reflection of the towering dune in the water creates a stunning optical illusion, like a deep abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, Crescent Lake has been sustained by natural groundwater. However, with the water table declining in recent years, the city of Dunhuang now artificially replenishes its groundwater to maintain the lake&amp;rsquo;s water level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small body of water supports a surprisingly vibrant ecosystem. We saw flocks of sparrows, a resident magpie, and even a stray cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/48572a7e5c2b002df93f87cc17e7728e.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As evening approached, the dunes began to take on a dramatic, three-dimensional texture. We decided to climb the nearest peak to watch night fall over the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/5e6a81df74e62d40c5d378246bcf3677.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dunes appear deceptively close. It&amp;rsquo;s only when you see the tiny silhouettes of people on the summit that you grasp their true scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/83c1997b1bac6d18a386f72f7ed5fc40.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the top just in time to see the lights around Crescent Lake switch on, their glow complementing the fading sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/23a8f1b2fc5901fe3d35f43f7d9a8925.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearby Crescent Lake Town is a new addition since our last visit. The park has added several new shows, which was a welcome surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/df50002be1ebb0314f54ebf5a571df3a.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 8:30 PM, the Starry Sky Concert kicked off in the town. There were no live singers, just a DJ playing a setlist over powerful speakers aimed at the dunes, with a host pumping up the energy. Tourists, glow sticks in hand, covered the entire hillside. The younger crowd belted out Power Station&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Dang&amp;rdquo; with infectious enthusiasm during the mass singalong. I even saw a woman in her twenties, there by herself, spontaneously break into a street dance. Everyone was completely immersed, and the energy was contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/a780b50bcfc6f241803d70857af41717.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concert was a surprise, as we had only intended to climb the dune for the view. On the other side, the rising moon illuminated a completely different world—one of perfect tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/ad5e3aff667a89993d2a39a3585c14d9.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the concert neared its end, a swarm of lights appeared from behind a distant dune. My first time seeing a drone show in person was here, in the middle of the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day at the park was for more sand play and camel riding, but we had a &amp;ldquo;secret mission.&amp;rdquo; In the afternoon, we visited a photo studio outside the park where my wife and daughter got a &amp;ldquo;Feitian&amp;rdquo; (flying Apsara) makeover, transforming into an ethereal mother-daughter duo. These studios are everywhere and offer full photo packages, but we opted for just the costumes and makeup, with yours truly behind the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/53123d0c76c0dd62e213550af24eeb9c.webp"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focused on portraits that day, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t take many landscape shots. After the photoshoot, we skipped the concert and headed back to the city for a celebratory dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-turbulent-return"&gt;A Turbulent Return
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our last day, we had a flight back to Hangzhou. We chose a connecting flight through Lanzhou to avoid the early morning direct one. While the trip out was smooth, the return flights were uncomfortable. My daughter started feeling dizzy as we approached Lanzhou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a 30-minute rest in Lanzhou, we boarded the next plane. The descent into Hangzhou was turbulent, and my daughter succumbed to motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, a thunderstorm was raging in Hangzhou. Our plane aborted its landing attempt at Xiaoshan Airport and had to divert to Wenzhou to wait for clearance. The Wenzhou airport was packed with other diverted flights, all queued up. After a long wait, the weather in Hangzhou finally cleared, and a 40-minute flight later, we landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we got a taxi home, it was past 1 AM. We had spent over 10 hours on planes—as long as an international flight—leaving everyone drained. But my daughter&amp;rsquo;s motion sickness lingered. Halfway home, she got sick again all over the taxi, followed by several more episodes. We finally got home, cleaned up, and fell into bed after 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She probably won&amp;rsquo;t want to get on a plane for a few years. But it was a test, and it was a clear sign that we&amp;rsquo;re not quite ready for long-haul international travel just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="travel-notes"&gt;Travel Notes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visiting Dunhuang in early September is far more pleasant than in April, as you avoid the risk of sandstorms. Temperatures are about 10°C warmer, and a short-sleeved shirt with a light, long-sleeved sun-shirt is perfect for both day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Route is a long haul. There are no public buses, and taxis won&amp;rsquo;t go that far, so your options are a tour, a chartered car, or self-driving. Yadan is a two-hour drive one-way from the city, and the basic park tour takes another two hours. If you go to Yadan, you&amp;rsquo;ll have time for at most one other stop on the route. It’s an incredible place for sunset, but with a young child&amp;rsquo;s bedtime and Dunhuang&amp;rsquo;s sunset being two hours later than Beijing time, we had to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chartered a car for the day and had a great chat with our local driver. I was surprised to learn that Dunhuang has hydropower; he used to work at one of the local stations. Despite the flat terrain, it plays a supporting role in Dunhuang&amp;rsquo;s energy mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/5dc6bdf821f0535110eabc4c24b4ab26.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver pointed out two common types of trees in the area: poplar and Lombardy poplar. The photo above was taken at the West Thousand Buddha Caves, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if these are the same. He explained that all the roadside trees are irrigated through underground pipes every 20 days or so. With maybe only five rainy days a year and rarely more than a drizzle, it&amp;rsquo;s a testament to the immense, unseen effort required to maintain greenery in a desert city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/a32afb3f53580d4f91a9f768f4983d41.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercially, the Shazhou Night Market in downtown Dunhuang has grown exponentially in the last four years. What was once a single short food street is now a sprawling network of six or seven alleys filled with restaurants, souvenir shops, and photo studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across from the market&amp;rsquo;s south gate, we stumbled upon a restaurant called &amp;ldquo;Chen Lao Ba Mutton Fen Tang.&amp;rdquo; We loved it so much we went twice, and our daughter ate heartily. The owner was incredibly passionate, coming over to explain the different cuts of lamb on our plate. Seeing us trim the fat off, he looked genuinely shocked and exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;But that&amp;rsquo;s the best part! What are you even eating?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/1fa82c47107fae226bc00e742b0302cd.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An after-dinner stroll through the quiet local streets outside the market offered a novel and atmospheric experience, with their khaki-colored walls, warm yellow lamplight, and distinctly desert-like poplar trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breakdown of our trip expenses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/26132143bd13e568e2e227440d53a9d4.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two trips, we feel we&amp;rsquo;ve now checked off all the major highlights of Dunhuang. Perhaps our next visit will be a stop on a grander Qinghai-Gansu loop tour—an adventure we&amp;rsquo;re already looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>敦煌二刷遛娃5天4夜</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/a-revisit-to-dunhuang/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 00:28:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/a-revisit-to-dunhuang/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/f0f9c750741f37672e767b157114d821.webp" alt="Featured image of post 敦煌二刷遛娃5天4夜" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;距离上一次敦煌游已经过去4年了，女儿日渐长大，终于可以尝试出一趟远门了。带女儿去见识沙漠戈壁，这是与江南山水完全不同的环境。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;带着小孩对交通住宿要求较高，锁定了3个相对成熟的玩沙点：敦煌鸣沙山、宁夏沙坡头、内蒙古响沙湾。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;敦煌以前去过，当时写了篇详细的游记：&lt;a class="link" href="https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;敦煌自驾5天4夜&lt;/a&gt;，主要景点都覆盖了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;宁夏沙坡头是沙漠+黄河景观，又是另一种风格。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;内蒙古响沙湾风景较前两个差一些，纯粹是个沙漠里的度假村。但是商业成熟游乐设施多，甚至还有沙漠水乐园。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;和老婆商量来商量去，决定二刷敦煌。地方熟悉不易踩坑，而且还有雅丹，上次留下的遗憾。整个大西北我们俩就去过一次，二刷竟然还去同一个地方，足见这座城市的魅力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/359778400fcbf9e47d939b5ebe8fd488.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025年的情况，杭州到敦煌有唯一一趟直飞航班，中午过后出发，傍晚到敦煌。女儿第一次坐飞机，很开心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们的行程，首尾2天没有游玩时间，半天在机场和飞机上。中间3天，第1天走西线看雅丹，后2天去鸣沙山月牙泉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="西千佛洞"&gt;西千佛洞
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/b01193f7c43433b48dd387b9bd5bd768.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是西线一个沿途景点，去雅丹顺便看了看。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌莫高窟也叫千佛洞，在敦煌市的东边。在西边还有一个形制类似规模较小的石窟群，就是这个西千佛洞。若不是这方面的研究学者，一般游客参观了莫高窟其实没必要再来这了，所以此处游客非常少。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/aa6631f13fae08babc0934f0a7c1ab68.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们去过莫高窟，娃太小对于石窟很可能不感兴趣，但看几眼长长见识也不错。来这刚刚好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们跟着讲解员参观了4个洞窟，禁止拍照。这边的石像损毁比较严重，但壁画不输莫高窟。几个细节印象较深，莫高窟没有：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;全敦煌唯一的帐篷顶石窟，顶部沿着中央横梁往两侧斜坡下降，体现游牧民族文化。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;损毁的雕像在民国时期尝试过重塑，但工作进行到一半就停了，可以看到佛像的木芯捆草裹泥工艺。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;沙洲回鹘政权对此地的佛像壁画有过大规模修缮，有一处层叠壁画。回鹘人在隋唐壁画上覆上白墙重新作画，岁月侵蚀白墙颜色变淡，透出下层壁画，两个时代的壁画重叠在一起。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外一些细节，诸如隋代佛像多以男性形象出现、释迦牟尼两大弟子阿难和迦叶的形象差别、壁画人物服装为古代服饰研究提供线索等，在莫高窟也有体现。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="雅丹地质公园"&gt;雅丹地质公园
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;雅丹是西线最远的景点，西线的公路通到这里就没有了，是断头路。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/0ea22c19aefaca61c2d3de0f6301ddc4.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;初到雅丹，相信没有人不被震撼。即使熟悉沙漠的人，在这也是崭新的体验。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这种完全平坦的地形，上面立着的雅丹体也都是清一色的水平纹理，加上遥远的天际线，在视觉上把水平方向延伸到了极致，给人以一种极其广阔的感觉，是混沌的大自然中产生的神奇秩序。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/436c397c22ad624676e3e139feeda3ea.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;要说这种感觉和什么像，我觉得是飞机上看到的平流层底部云海。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这种景观的形成过程本身就充满了秩序，才得以创造出如此整齐的视觉效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;借用雅丹官网的图，一眼就能看出它的演变过程。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在中更新世（约30–10万年前），敦煌—罗布泊被淡水湖泊覆盖，水的沉积创造了绝对水平的整齐土层。到晚更新世（约10–1万年前），陆地抬升，湖泊干涸，土层暴露出来，经受昼夜温差的破坏。同时新的地形条件带来了持续的大风，不断磨蚀这些土层。这个作用有点像水流冲刷形成河谷，强风在土层里劈开了一条条道路，形成垄岗状雅丹。风力和冷热交替继续把长条形的垄岗状雅丹变薄、切断，形成墙状雅丹、塔状雅丹、柱状雅丹，最后坍塌，消失在风中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以雅丹地貌是一个动态变化过程，我们如今看到的是它生命中最灿烂的时刻。再过上万年，此地的雅丹将会完全消失。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="观光巴士"&gt;观光巴士
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;第一段行程，跟随大巴车参观，逐个景点停留观赏。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/2e1a98ff741f5c203985c8898fa598c1.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先来到了建在雅丹体里的一座派出所，当年开发此地所需的配套设施。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/aa63efde2305501258f317c59d2610a9.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;景区里的雅丹体形似各种物体，最逼真的是这个孔雀玉立，惟妙惟肖。不过女儿目前还感受不到这种景观的妙处。这个景点休息区有秋千椅，女儿和我在这开开心心荡秋千。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/bd20b325630320f0d9713bf777fd3365.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;随后的众多景点中，最壮观的要数西海舰队。如此大量的垄岗状雅丹世所罕见。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/11e753d1361701b8a2c83e06e360004c.gif"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;来个动图感受一下。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/850c2abf3e3c4f41189676a268f6b75c.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里大部分地方没有植物，黑色砂石起到了植物的作用，固定住下方的沙土，减少风力对地形的改变。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="电动越野车"&gt;电动越野车
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/f7f38b1fbb15cd563a51b7d932b23209.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大致标注了一下地图，红色是观光巴士路线。这张图足够大，可以保存下来看。据我观察和推测，景区里至少有3种越野车：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;图上的“越野车站点”，就是孔雀玉立景点，这是第1个遇到的越野车站点，我们没坐。工作人员介绍说，越野车的路线和观光车只有一小段不同，只走公路，但随时可以停。我猜想它可能会去观光巴士返程路上那个蓝色小环线绕一下。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在蓝色路线的起点位置，会遇到第2个越野车站点，我们租了这种，￥298/车。全程自驾，随时可停，但必须沿着一条石子路走，不可偏离。它是一种速度较慢的电动车，如果完全不停的话大约20分钟可以开到终点。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;电动越野车路线终点，是景区的最佳日落观赏点，在这里会看到另一种越野车，还有像船一样造型的沙漠冲锋巴士。工作人员说这里的车可以沿着绿色线路开进戈壁腹地，沙地行车，再原路返回。能走多远我就不太确定了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/16e0724cdaef73eabfafb9e4159ba7d0.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们在电动越野车路线上走走停停，到处拍照，坐在戈壁滩上吃自带的哈密瓜。20分钟的车程玩了快2个小时。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如果是曾经的魔兽世界玩家，应该更能理解我在雅丹的这种欣喜。贫瘠之地、千针石林、闪光平原……看到眼前这些恍如时空交错的画面，会有一种想要独自走向戈壁深处的冲动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;雅丹的各景点像这个像那个，有的神似有的牵强。但要我说，如果去掉人类的想象投射，它本身的形态就是最纯粹的自然之美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="鸣沙山月牙泉"&gt;鸣沙山月牙泉
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;后面两天来鸣沙山月牙泉，这是个理想的沙漠遛娃点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在国内你很少能找到距离城市如此之近的沙漠景区，沙漠的狂野和浪漫丝毫不减，但从酒店打车过去只要十几分钟。门票可以连续3天不限次进出，对酒泉市、嘉峪关市、青海油田和其他一些本地身份免门票，具体政策可以查查官方公众号。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/fccc1820a27b6dbd465ec60b495d8bd1.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;景区有多个门，中门是正门，打车默认就是到这里。中门进来景观如上，正午十分还不是最美时刻，夕阳下的沙丘光影分明，会有更强的立体感。我&lt;a class="link" href="https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;上一次来敦煌的游记&lt;/a&gt;里有更多照片。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;景区分东西两个区，东区是热气球越野车滑翔机等付费游乐项目，没什么明显的地面道路，主打一个挑战征服自然。西区是骆驼营地月牙泉，观光车也是往这边去的，主打一个西域浪漫情怀。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;东区游乐设施上次来已经玩过了，而且基本不接受低龄儿童，我们就直奔西区了。烈日当空，带女儿在月牙泉边找个遮阳棚坐下，自由玩沙。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/f0f9c750741f37672e767b157114d821.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里有我最喜欢的一处沙丘。画面外左下方就是月牙泉，这一处沙丘的造型、层次、山脊弧度都恰到好处，透着一股孤独的力量。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;太阳角度逐渐降低，开始带女儿游玩。女儿一点也不害怕骆驼，每天都骑了一遍，要不是时间原因，她打算再额外骑一次。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/0a940b1061b67e4f782aac2acb7a5799.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;参观月牙泉。泉边有一处月泉阁，小院周围郁郁葱葱，可登阁赏泉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/59c6101ade7ddbf4e1ca7924ccc8a260.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;漫漫黄沙中，这样一座干净的泉边小院显得不太真实。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/26c0cff2bbe85c78f5aaecde2d03f363.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从高处俯瞰月牙泉，对面沙丘倒映在泉里。像一面斜坡直插水中，形成了一种深渊般的视觉幻象，十分奇妙。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;月牙泉能常年存在于沙丘中，靠的是天然的地下水。但近年来地下水正在逐渐枯竭，敦煌市为保护这一自然奇观，人工引水补充地下水源，维持着月牙泉的水位。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一方小泉水，在沙漠中维持着一个繁荣的生态系统。在这里生活着成群的麻雀，还有一只喜鹊在此安家，我们甚至还看到了一只流浪猫。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/48572a7e5c2b002df93f87cc17e7728e.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;傍晚时分，沙丘的立体感出来了。我们决定爬上离月牙泉最近的山顶，观赏夜幕降临。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/5e6a81df74e62d40c5d378246bcf3677.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沙丘看着近在咫尺，看到山顶的人影时，你才能意识到它的高大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/83c1997b1bac6d18a386f72f7ed5fc40.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;登上山顶，赶上月牙泉灯光亮起，和夕阳交相辉映。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/23a8f1b2fc5901fe3d35f43f7d9a8925.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;附近是月牙泉小镇。整个景区相比我们上一次来，新增了不少节目，给我们带来了新的体验。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/df50002be1ebb0314f54ebf5a571df3a.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;晚上8点半，星空音乐会在小镇开幕。没有歌手，大功率音响向着整个沙丘播放固定歌单，主持人活跃氛围。游客们手持荧光棒，坐满了整个山丘。万人大合唱，小年轻们唱动力火车的《当》唱得可卖力了。我还看到个20来岁的小姑娘，没有同伴，兴致正盛当街来了一段即兴街舞。大伙是真的忘我投入，氛围极具感染力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/a780b50bcfc6f241803d70857af41717.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，这个音乐会在意料之外，我们原本是想爬上山顶看风景的。沙丘的另一面，明月升起，完全是另一个静谧的世界。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/ad5e3aff667a89993d2a39a3585c14d9.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;音乐会临近结束，远方沙丘背后许多星星点点灯光飞来。我第一次亲眼看无人机秀居然是在沙漠里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后一天再来鸣沙山月牙泉，还是玩沙和骑骆驼。不过这天有个神秘任务，下午去景区外面找了家摄影工作室，娘俩一番妆造变身大小飞天，仙气飘飘。这样的工作室景区外遍地都是，可以妆造+拍摄。我们选择了只要妆造，摄影师就爸爸来当吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/53123d0c76c0dd62e213550af24eeb9c.webp"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一天拍人为主，没留下多少风景照。傍晚拍完收工，没有再看音乐会了，赶回市区吃大餐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="返程的波折"&gt;返程的波折
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;最后一天飞机回杭州，由于直飞那趟时间太早，选了个在兰州经停的航班。不知什么原因，虽然去程一切顺利，没想到回程起降都感觉不太舒服，飞机快到兰州时女儿一直喊头晕。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在兰州候机大厅休整半个小时，上飞机继续长途飞行。靠近杭州时，飞机下降过程比较颠簸，女儿终于憋不住吐了出来，晕机了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;恰逢杭州暴风雨，飞机在萧山机场上空尝试降落又半途拉升。接到地面信息，当前无法降落。只好飞温州机场，降落后在地面等待指示。此时温州机场停满了改降的飞机，大家都在排队等着起飞。等了好久，最终杭州天气转好，又飞了40分钟抵达杭州。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;出机场后打车回家。女儿似乎已经缓过来了，情绪不错。已经凌晨1点多了，在飞机上总共待了10多个小时，不亚于一趟国际航班，大家都很疲惫。但女儿的晕机还没完全过去，半途又是哇的一声，吐了一车。随后又陆陆续续吐了好几轮。到家只好仔细清洁一番，睡下已是2点多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可能女儿好几年都不想再坐飞机了。不过这也算是个测试，至少我们知道了，近几年还不具备长途国际旅行的条件。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="游玩花絮"&gt;游玩花絮
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;9月初来敦煌，相比上一次4月份来，气候更加宜人，而且能避开4月份可能的沙尘暴。昼夜比4月份要各高10度左右，短袖外面套一件长袖防晒衣足够了，日夜兼顾。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;西线非常远，没有公交，打车也不行，只能跟团、包车或租车自驾。雅丹位于西线的末端，从敦煌市过去单程就要2小时，在景区内只坐观光车大概也要2小时。所以如果打算去雅丹，其他西线景点最多只能再选一个。雅丹是很适合看日落的地方，只是小孩要早睡，敦煌日落又比北京时间晚2个小时，我们没这机会了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们西线这天选择了包车。一路跟本地师傅聊过去，才知道敦煌这个城市居然也有水电，师傅以前在敦煌的水电站工作过。虽然戈壁平原落差小，但水电也给敦煌的能源起到了一定补充作用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/5dc6bdf821f0535110eabc4c24b4ab26.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌本地随处可见两种树，司机师傅说一种是白杨，一种是钻天杨。但我这张图拍摄于西千佛洞，不确定是不是这两种。据师傅介绍，敦煌这些行道树下方都有水管，每二十几天就会浇一次水。毕竟敦煌一年的降水可能也就5天，大雨基本没有，能打湿地面就不错了。维持沙漠城市绿化，需要许多看不见的努力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/a32afb3f53580d4f91a9f768f4983d41.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;商业方面，敦煌市中心的沙洲夜市比4年前扩大了好多倍。之前只是一条短短的小吃街，现在扩展出六七条纵横交错的街巷，餐饮、文创、旅拍各种店铺都有。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;夜市南门一街之隔，我们偶遇一家“陈老八羊肉粉汤”，很合我们胃口，女儿吃得也很香，光顾2次了。老板挺热情，见我们是外地游客，特意上前来介绍我们盘里的手抓羊肉哪块是哪个部位。看见我们俩把肥肉剔除掉，老板表示很震惊，用不成器的口气感叹：“那你们吃的是啥啊！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/1fa82c47107fae226bc00e742b0302cd.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;夜市外面的本地小街巷，饭后消食可以去逛逛。卡其色的民宅墙壁，昏黄的灯光，还有沙漠风情十足的白杨，是非常新颖的体验。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;此行开支明细：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-09/26132143bd13e568e2e227440d53a9d4.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，这两趟下来，我们把敦煌最值得玩的地方都玩遍了。也许下次再去，就只是青甘大环线顺带路过了，也非常值得期待。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zhejiang Museum of Surveying, Mapping, and Geoinformation</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/zhejiang-surveying-mapping-and-geoinformation-museum/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 13:33:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/zhejiang-surveying-mapping-and-geoinformation-museum/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0049b42bd1c2729ff1c7646e92e61d5c.webp" alt="Featured image of post Zhejiang Museum of Surveying, Mapping, and Geoinformation" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a whim, I took a day off to explore this niche museum I&amp;rsquo;d stumbled upon. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the Zhejiang Academy of Surveying and Mapping Science and Technology. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect much, planning just a quick look, but the quality was surprisingly high. The very first exhibit had me hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum spans two floors. The first floor traces the history of Chinese surveying and mapping from ancient to modern times. The second floor features two halls: one on modern applications of surveying and GIS (Geographic Information System), and another on maps. The GIS hall is packed with interactive, kid-friendly exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time was short—just one morning—so I snapped as many photos as I could to pore over later, though I still missed most of it. Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick virtual tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ancient-chinese-surveying-and-mapping"&gt;Ancient Chinese Surveying and Mapping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hall on ancient surveying techniques posed a question we moderns rarely consider: without rigorous science like geometry, did early humans rely purely on intuition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our perception can be vague, interacting with the physical world demands precision. The laws of physics make quantitative measurement a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vertical-surveying"&gt;Vertical Surveying
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take well-digging. The ancients couldn&amp;rsquo;t just dig on a whim. A well had to be perfectly vertical to prevent collapse and make drawing water easier. They might not have known about gravity, but they understood that a hanging weight points straight down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/4c140fd538d8f1ccccc8028530c77154.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pointed piece of wood in the bottom left is a plumb bob, suspended by a rope from the well&amp;rsquo;s center. The large wooden stake next to it is a sighting pile. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to see through the glass, but there&amp;rsquo;s a small hollow carved in its top. While digging, they kept the plumb bob pointing at that hollow. As the well deepened, the rope lengthened, and the sighting pile was moved lower. With this setup, they could keep the well perfectly vertical, as shown in the diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple setup was the world&amp;rsquo;s earliest surveying tool. This method is still used in construction today. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of it: the plumb line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="horizontal-surveying"&gt;Horizontal Surveying
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While gravity makes finding &amp;lsquo;up&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;down&amp;rsquo; easy, the horizontal plane is trickier to measure precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/90c6604d4a20c66b7145658331fec758.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where maps come in. Cave paintings weren&amp;rsquo;t just art; alongside scenes of daily life and belief, ancient people drew highly practical maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 3,500-year-old rock painting of a settlement in Cangyuan, Yunnan, shows the distribution of houses and roads—an abstraction of the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further I walked, the more I appreciated the genius of the map. As land-bound creatures who can&amp;rsquo;t fly, our world is essentially two-dimensional. We don&amp;rsquo;t burrow underground or float in the air, so it&amp;rsquo;s natural to represent our world on a flat surface, ignoring altitude and focusing on the cardinal directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A map is the ultimate tool for filtering key information from the noise of the natural world. A tribal chief cared where the houses, roads, and livestock were, but not how many trees were in a certain area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="from-qualitative-to-quantitative"&gt;From Qualitative to Quantitative
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Cangyuan rock painting is purely qualitative. It shows a house is near a road, but not how far. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell us which of two houses is closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Without quantitative data, we can&amp;rsquo;t make comparisons at scales beyond what the eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand the world through comparison, relating new concepts to what we already know. By spotting similarities and differences, we learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I tell you the Earth&amp;rsquo;s circumference is 40,000 kilometers, the number is too big to grasp. But if I say that light can circle the Earth 7.5 times per second, you get it. The fastest thing we know takes a noticeable amount of time to circle our planet, which means Earth is immense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 7.5 is a quantitative expression. Numbers allow for comparison, and using math to measure the world frees us from vague intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare numbers, they must share the same units. Which is longer, one meter or one zhang? Without a conversion, nobody knows. Standardizing units unifies a country&amp;rsquo;s mathematical language. Yes, math has dialects: calculation methods are grammar, and units are pronunciation. When everyone speaks the same mathematical language, people from different regions can trade more easily or collaborate on building the Great Wall, enabling the efficient flow of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puts Emperor Qin Shi Huang&amp;rsquo;s standardization of weights and measures in a new light. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a grand gesture; it was a practical necessity for ruling a vast empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibit also revealed something I&amp;rsquo;d never considered: the Qin Dynasty had officials specifically in charge of surveying and cartography. This shows how crucial these tasks were to the state; at such a macro level, no decision could be based on feeling alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With standardized units and measurement techniques, it became possible to shrink vast territories onto small maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A topographic map from Mawangdui Tomb No. 3. I&amp;rsquo;ve transcribed the description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring 96x96 cm, it depicts the southern part of the Changsha Kingdom in the early Western Han Dynasty, now the upper Xiang River, the Nanling and Jiuyi Mountains, and surrounding areas. The orientation is south-up. The scale is roughly 1:170,000 to 1:190,000. Analysis confirms it is a surveyed topographic map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/64c6a060c02cfe3c0adc20a0147b3058.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with the geography of Hunan and Guangxi. Note that the Mawangdui map must be rotated 180 degrees to match modern maps. Over 2,000 years, river systems may have changed, but the mountains still seem to align well. Can any friends from Hunan or Guangxi comment on the accuracy of this Han Dynasty survey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-math-behind-surveying"&gt;The Math Behind Surveying
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once surveying methods exist, someone is bound to create a science out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;geometry(n.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;early 14c., also &lt;em&gt;gemetrie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gemetry&lt;/em&gt;, from Old French &lt;em&gt;geometrie&lt;/em&gt; (12c., Modern French &lt;em&gt;géométrie&lt;/em&gt;), from Latin &lt;em&gt;geometria&lt;/em&gt;, from Greek &lt;em&gt;geometria&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;measurement of earth or land; &lt;em&gt;geometry&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; from combining form of &lt;em&gt;gē&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;earth, land&amp;rdquo; (see &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/Gaia" title="Etymology, meaning and definition of Gaia"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;) + &lt;em&gt;-metria&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;a measuring of&amp;rdquo; (see &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/-metry" title="Etymology, meaning and definition of -metry"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;-metry&lt;/a&gt;). Old English used &lt;em&gt;eorðcræft&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;earth-craft&amp;rdquo; as a loan-translation of Latin &lt;em&gt;geometria&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;geometry&amp;rdquo; traces back to ancient Greece, where it meant &amp;ldquo;earth measurement.&amp;rdquo; It allowed for objective comparisons of land area, settling disputes between farmers. From such practical problems, this science of shapes emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/6559ba2b53df7c0ed1b67c7e76591756.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China had its own geometric pioneers. Liu Hui, a mathematician of the Three Kingdoms period, wrote a treatise on measuring the height of a sea island in his commentary on the &lt;em&gt;Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&lt;/em&gt;. It systematically used the principle of similar triangles to remotely measure an island&amp;rsquo;s height without setting foot on it. This was China&amp;rsquo;s first mathematical work on surveying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring a sea island might sound trivial, but it freed surveyors from physical constraints, enabling the remote measurement of large, distant objects. The principle of similar triangles is foundational to modern astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/8e1c45738bdc368bb40f24c886bb70b8.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nearby interactive exhibit demonstrated the principle. Tapping the screen showed an ancient cartoon figure with a pole, taking a few measurements to get the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place a pole of known height, step back until its top visually aligns with the island peak, and record the horizontal distance to the pole. That creates a small right triangle (eye–pole top–pole base) similar to the large triangle (eye–island peak–island base). One sighting gives a ratio between height and distance but leaves both unknown. Repeat from a second spot farther out along the same sightline with another pole and measure the separation between the two pole positions. Those two similar-triangle equations plus the known separation give two equations for two unknowns, allowing you to solve for the island’s height and distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, not only is the island&amp;rsquo;s height calculated, but the distance to it is found as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="measuring-water-levels-the-grand-canal"&gt;Measuring Water Levels: The Grand Canal
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With basic math, even without systematic physics, ancient people could build incredible things, like a nationwide canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a question: Is the water level of the 1,700-km Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal constant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impossible. The terrain varies, with some cities on high ground and others in lowlands. A canal built at a high elevation would flood low-lying cities if it leaked. Building it at a low elevation would require carving through mountains to reach higher cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/41f210d0f382e6d8f8ff8babc922d509.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, canals are built in sections, each with its own water level. The Panama Canal, for example, uses locks to separate segments. A chamber between two segments changes its water level. A ship enters, the gate behind it closes, and water from the next segment flows in, raising the ship to the next level. Step by step, the ship conquers the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An astute observer might ask: doesn&amp;rsquo;t water constantly flow out of the higher sections? Yes, it does. A canal isn&amp;rsquo;t a self-sustaining system; it needs external water sources to replenish the upper levels. A dry season could even shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/ce5ed44b99341b4c6acac61b1d335cb7.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, building the Grand Canal was more than just digging a long trench. It required immense, precise surveying and calculation to find suitable routes. Guo Shoujing of the Yuan Dynasty was the first in China to use &amp;ldquo;sea level&amp;rdquo; as a baseline to compare canal sections, introducing the concept of &amp;ldquo;altitude.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of trivia: The Grand Canal was built during the Sui Dynasty, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;ldquo;Beijing-Hangzhou&amp;rdquo; Grand Canal at first. The Sui capital was Chang&amp;rsquo;an, and later Luoyang. A canal would have to serve the capital. The original main artery was centered on Luoyang, connecting the northern plains to the southern Jiangnan region, funneling goods to the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the later Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the political focus shifted north, and the importance of Chang&amp;rsquo;an and Luoyang faded. Massive resources were poured into the canal between Beijing and Hangzhou, which gradually became the main trunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this from the &lt;strong&gt;Canal Museum&lt;/strong&gt; by the Gongchen Bridge in Hangzhou. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, major cities along the canal likely have their own museums documenting this history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="measuring-the-earth-the-meridian-line"&gt;Measuring the Earth: The Meridian Line
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides measuring things on the ground, the ancients also measured the Earth itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/ce7a4647ce91cc9a0fcd8034e947c6dc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient civilizations worldwide, heaven and earth were seen as connected and mutually influential. The Tang dynasty monk Yi Xing was tasked with creating a more accurate astronomical calendar to predict celestial events and guide life on Earth. He set up 13 observation stations over a vast distance, from Mongolia to Vietnam, and had his teams simultaneously measure the altitude of the North Star and the length of the noon shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Earth is a sphere, the North Star&amp;rsquo;s altitude and the noon shadow&amp;rsquo;s length vary with latitude. Using this data, he calculated the arc length of a degree of the meridian with the highest accuracy of his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient China, &amp;ldquo;zi&amp;rdquo; meant north and &amp;ldquo;wu&amp;rdquo; south, so a &amp;ldquo;ziwu line&amp;rdquo; was a north-south arc on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface—what we call a meridian line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arc length of one degree of longitude is key data; it can be used to calculate the size of the Earth. This discovery could have sparked an age of exploration for China. But that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen, partly because the concept of a spherical Earth wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet widely accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="measuring-the-sky-the-cross-staff"&gt;Measuring the Sky: The Cross-Staff
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ancients also measured the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/b118e9fef8ec73f7849605189bd7b7c0.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At sea, with no landmarks, the sky is the only guide. By day, you have the sun. At night, what do you have? The moon is unreliable; as Earth&amp;rsquo;s satellite, its position is too variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient nighttime navigation relied on the stars. This worked because the distant stars form a fixed map in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, stars aren&amp;rsquo;t completely fixed; their own motion and the Earth&amp;rsquo;s precession slowly change their positions. But these changes are so gradual that for ancient navigators, the stars were a stable and information-rich guide, even more so than the sun. The challenge was learning to read this celestial &amp;ldquo;map.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/de8a1e112a8b6583ea2627aa422caee1.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross-staff was a tool for measuring a ship&amp;rsquo;s latitude, usually by sighting the North Star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/4796ad5682a85b522c4735fbb338c504.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks complex, but the principle is simple. You select one of the square boards. Holding it at arm&amp;rsquo;s length, you align its bottom edge with the horizon. If the top edge lines up with the North Star, you&amp;rsquo;ve found the star&amp;rsquo;s altitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/93b265f7c295d178ccf6e0974020b81f.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the &amp;ldquo;six-finger&amp;rdquo; board lines up, you&amp;rsquo;d say, &amp;ldquo;The North Star is six fingers high.&amp;rdquo; This measurement could be converted to latitude using a table. A &amp;ldquo;finger&amp;rdquo; was a unit of about 2cm. If the alignment wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, you&amp;rsquo;d try a smaller or larger board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, this crude device played a huge role in Zheng He&amp;rsquo;s voyages. The method was obviously prone to error—arm lengths differ, and holding the board perfectly vertical on a rocking ship is difficult. But this principle inspired more advanced instruments, like the sextant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I found an &lt;a class="link" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMjg4OTI1OQ==&amp;amp;mid=2247487525&amp;amp;idx=2&amp;amp;sn=870ada9649cf86a215a50f8f08e1174a&amp;amp;chksm=97be6be1a0c9e2f7df6793c00f778eb92fc28ac1fff95732a7c9a7b447356d6ba6c052fa8f47#rd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;article from the museum&amp;rsquo;s official WeChat account&lt;/a&gt; that details how to use the cross-staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross-staff and sextant measure latitude. Longitude was a much harder problem for all ancient seafaring civilizations. But why was knowing only latitude so useful? If you were sailing to a known location, you could look up its latitude, sail north or south until you reached that latitude, and then simply sail east or west along it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I suspect this method would be less effective in archipelagos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nationwide-large-scale-surveys"&gt;Nationwide Large-Scale Surveys
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rulers throughout history recognized the benefits of accurate measurement and periodically launched nationwide survey campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guo Shoujing of the Yuan Dynasty was ordered to conduct a nationwide survey, rivaling Yi Xing&amp;rsquo;s in scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compile a new calendar, Guo Shoujing led an unprecedented &amp;ldquo;Four Seas Survey.&amp;rdquo; It ranged from the Paracel Islands in the south to near the Arctic Circle. Using instruments he invented, like the simplified armillary sphere (Jianyi), he measured the latitudes of 27 locations with accuracy very close to modern values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what is now Dengfeng, Henan, Guo Shoujing built an observatory that functioned as a giant gnomon; it&amp;rsquo;s the oldest surviving observatory in China. To improve accuracy, he invented a &amp;ldquo;shadow definer&amp;rdquo; that used a pinhole to measure shadow length to within ±2 millimeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/da8abe57424bb8b649e2272cc9572a52.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Jianyi, a simplified armillary sphere. It looks anything but simple, but its function was direct: to measure a celestial body&amp;rsquo;s coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time was running short, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t examine the Jianyi closely. I was the only visitor, and a staff member, noticing my interest, told me I could use the paper from the entrance to make a souvenir map rubbing. I chose the &amp;ldquo;Mountains and Rivers of the Nine Provinces.&amp;rdquo; Here&amp;rsquo;s the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/fcc0bf2c2d9ea516b9476357c3968207.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked how large the museum was and realized I&amp;rsquo;d seen only a fifth of it in half a day. I sped up, stopping only for things that immediately caught my eye and taking photos of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/37b26e82075a2f9a007cfab7a92a80d9.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renowned scholar-emperor Kangxi personally studied and directed a massive survey that produced the &lt;em&gt;Huangyu Quanlan Tu&lt;/em&gt; (Map of the Imperial Territories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty personally directed a large-scale survey using latitude, longitude, and triangulation. It produced 641 coordinate points across the country. Combined with China&amp;rsquo;s vast geographical literature, this data was used to create the &lt;em&gt;Huangyu Quanlan Tu&lt;/em&gt;, China&amp;rsquo;s first map based on measured coordinates. Its coverage, accuracy, and speed were unparalleled in the world at the time. The project also led to the first survey of Mount Everest and provided the first empirical evidence that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, marking a great leap for Chinese surveying technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the &amp;ldquo;first discovery that the Earth is an oblate spheroid,&amp;rdquo; I did some digging. With so much data, they spotted a pattern: the arc length of one degree of latitude was longer at high latitudes than at low latitudes. This meant the Earth is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. The difference between Earth&amp;rsquo;s polar and equatorial diameters is just 0.33%—a tiny discrepancy on a planetary scale, discoverable only through precise measurement. However, &amp;ldquo;first discovery&amp;rdquo; should really be &amp;ldquo;first confirmed,&amp;rdquo; as Newton had already theorized an oblate spheroid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this led me to a contradiction: why does a &lt;strong&gt;longer arc length at higher latitudes&lt;/strong&gt; mean the &lt;strong&gt;poles are flatter&lt;/strong&gt;? My intuition said the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0ae3180f5d50905eccaa0f44b5d71774.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s exaggerate. If the Earth spun much faster, centrifugal force would flatten it like a lens. A cross-section would show that the meridian arc from 0 to 45 degrees is clearly longer than the arc from 45 to 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid being tricked by intuition, I reasoned it out. A quarter meridian can be divided into 90 one-degree arcs. If the high-latitude arcs are longer, then &lt;code&gt;... &amp;lt; arc 44-45 &amp;lt; arc 45-46 &amp;lt; ...&lt;/code&gt;. Logically, the total arc length above 45 degrees should be greater than that below it. But my diagram shows the opposite. Where&amp;rsquo;s the flaw?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research, I found the flaw was in my understanding of &amp;ldquo;latitude.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re used to thinking of Earth as a perfect sphere where latitude lines are evenly spaced. On a perfect sphere, definitions of latitude don&amp;rsquo;t matter. But on an oblate spheroid, the two common definitions differ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geodetic Latitude&lt;/strong&gt;: The angle between the normal (a line perpendicular to the surface) and the equatorial plane. This line does not necessarily pass through the Earth&amp;rsquo;s center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geocentric Latitude&lt;/strong&gt;: The angle between a line from the surface to the Earth&amp;rsquo;s center and the equatorial plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/6dc886a8157b670d8f7534b344daf14f.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the diagram shows, 45 degrees geodetic latitude is not where you&amp;rsquo;d intuitively think it is. Conflict resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mistake was assuming geocentric latitude, a classic case of modern knowledge leading to a wrong assumption. Geographical latitude is geodetic. From an ancient perspective, geodetic latitude is far more intuitive and measurable—you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to believe the Earth is a sphere to use it. The concept of geocentric latitude, on the other hand, is meaningless without a spherical Earth model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough about latitude. Back to the &lt;em&gt;Huangyu Quanlan Tu&lt;/em&gt;. The museum had a QR code for an audio guide, which I&amp;rsquo;ve transcribed:&lt;/p&gt;

The theory of a round Earth is the basis for latitude and longitude measurement and map projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="modern-and-contemporary-chinese-surveying-and-mapping"&gt;Modern and Contemporary Chinese Surveying and Mapping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the ancient section, I skipped a small exhibit on modern history and went straight to the contemporary surveying area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="surveying-datums"&gt;Surveying Datums
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/4747c35ba94438ace05af5f50de03ac0.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up: national surveying datums. In plain English: what do we measure, and by what standards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/8e4e1eff407c12cf671d9994eb5dee26.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geodetic control network defines 3D coordinates. Ground survey reference stations are scattered across the country. Like the international prototype meter and kilogram, their coordinates are maintained with extreme precision, and all other locations are calculated relative to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involves ground stations, real-time satellite monitoring, and data centers. Even minute factors like tectonic plate movement are tracked, allowing the system to dynamically update the true coordinates of each station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/36ecbdad1a36014ac39a4914d6b6d855.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model of a classic geodetic origin. China&amp;rsquo;s geodetic origin is in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province. It was chosen in the last century because it was near the country&amp;rsquo;s geographical center and geologically stable. This facilitated the expansion of the control network nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, however, the network no longer uses a physical origin. With modern technology, the geodetic origin is defined as the Earth&amp;rsquo;s center of mass, in line with international standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/233be0e8b51119d960a8e4e0436c3944.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertical control network is similar, defining numerous reference points for altitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/4e6b491bc20622a39684e15df73aa374.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a model of a leveling benchmark, the starting point for altitude measurements, located on Guanxiang Hill in Qingdao.&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also reference points for gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/df4441616b5e83911c917f780f9fc953.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a network of reference stations for satellite navigation and positioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/b98cac1665d1a486d0c6e261487bc68e.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A satellite navigation and positioning reference station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="applications-of-datums"&gt;Applications of Datums
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can we do with these datums?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With accurate 3D coordinates, we can perform precise nationwide analysis for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/6ee5c87f9ba2e217d0319da262e2696e.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hu Huanyong Line diagonally divides China. A comparison of the two sides reveals a stark population imbalance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1935, geographer Hu Huanyong proposed a line dividing China&amp;rsquo;s population density. It runs from Heihe to Tengchong. At the time, 96% of the population lived on 36% of the land southeast of the line, while 4% lived on the other 64%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demographic divide persists. According to the 2010 census, 94% of the population lives on 43% of the land southeast of the line, with 6% on the remaining 57%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/e8e497389e7133b3fd640e8332ea7cc6.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hu didn&amp;rsquo;t just draw an arbitrary line. It&amp;rsquo;s a real geographical boundary where population density drops off sharply, and it has been stable for a long time. It reflects China&amp;rsquo;s geographical realities and closely matches the 400mm annual precipitation line. Monsoons, water resources, terrain, and history have all contributed to the distinctly different civilizations on either side: agricultural and pastoral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/d84fc3b57197eab0a86939267a924b6e.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first national geographical census determined the breakdown of cultivated land:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Area (10,000 sq km)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Percentage (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Paddy Field&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dry Land&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;109.52&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;68.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Orchard&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11.64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Other&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;159.91&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/6a8e2e5e8f7d8107165e7ea4de17aebc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also tallied the distribution of water resources by altitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Region&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Area (10,000 sq km)&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Extremely High Altitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;High Altitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22.86&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Medium Altitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Low Altitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13.43&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;65.04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20.65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/f4f85bbcbf3b4e947a0eca891963d348.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And vegetation cover by altitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Region&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Area (10,000 sq km)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Percentage (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Extremely High Altitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;37.42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;High Altitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;129.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21.62&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Medium Altitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;210.42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35.26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Low Altitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;219.94&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36.85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;596.78&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further on, an exhibit detailed the three measurements of Mount Everest&amp;rsquo;s height. The latest official height is 8848.86 meters to the &amp;ldquo;snow surface.&amp;rdquo; You can easily find the story behind this online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0214a860cc504173697b7707cb162cd3.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed a futuristic installation with a sleek console and an oddly shaped screen, like something from an alien spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/5b5a063dbd68f4edca19354ad8d79663.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an interactive exhibit on how survey data is used for earthquake disaster relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/9e14b3a9dac5687e3e057bc178e74fab.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another clever device: rotating discs on a barrel showed the historical changes of cities in Zhejiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/cfb6f8c7f78a595b3d058b84a56109ea.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern section on the first floor was much larger than I&amp;rsquo;ve shown. I didn&amp;rsquo;t photograph many of the display boards with dense text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/52741edf82f2aefffefa42f160e9bb9d.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I left the first-floor hall, I saw two opposing interactive walls. Touching a painting on the wall lit up the corresponding object, reminding visitors of the pervasive impact of surveying technology on modern society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/c5739df0da779e12686464b78c2814e6.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="applications-of-surveying-technology"&gt;Applications of Surveying Technology
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the second floor, the focus shifted from history to the technology itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/9963657c52e26b9c6a2c5f17ee28882c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it began with a touch of history, showcasing the geographical views of different civilizations over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the timeline: the theory of a spherical Earth was proposed in the 6th century BC. Two centuries later, there was already strong evidence to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 6th century BC, the ancient Greek Pythagoras proposed the concept of a spherical Earth. Two centuries later, Aristotle further argued for it based on the spherical shadow during a lunar eclipse, astronomical observations, and the way ships disappear over the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, nearly 2,000 years later, most people still believed the Earth was a flat disc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the 15th-17th centuries, many Europeans believed the ocean was a vast, flat plane ending in a waterfall. This view was gradually overturned during the Age of Discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful reminder of how long it can take for a now-obvious truth to overcome cognitive inertia. It also makes you wonder: what if the scientific spirit of ancient Greece had continued uninterrupted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="numerical-measurement"&gt;Numerical Measurement
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we knew the Earth was a sphere, we had to measure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/f0d6c408bea51397250150d71b619f71.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few related but distinct concepts are at play here. Imagine the Earth as a perfect ellipsoid (the green dashed line). The actual solid surface (mountains, seabeds) is uneven (the solid green line). You can&amp;rsquo;t use this uneven surface as a baseline for measuring height. A more uniform reference is sea level (the solid white line). But because Earth&amp;rsquo;s mass isn&amp;rsquo;t evenly distributed, the sea level (the geoid) doesn&amp;rsquo;t perfectly match a standard ellipse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/208cc31d8adf37bc15def1b21aa5e0b0.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;d just seen a NASA image of the geoid on social media. It gives you a great visual for how much the geoid, shaped by gravity, differs from a perfect sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/c15f8ca5c0f1c6b45e7840639e120053.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device lets you see how topographic maps are made. Using the geoid concept, imagine slicing the Earth with parallel planes at regular intervals. The lines where these planes intersect the terrain are the contour lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can shape the sand in the sandbox, and an overhead projector instantly redraws the contour lines on the new terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0049b42bd1c2729ff1c7646e92e61d5c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area was lined with an impressive collection of surveying instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/21e4761af32a594f08916793876fd0f9.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section on marine positioning caught my eye. The diagram shows two common acoustic positioning methods for missions at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-baseline method (left) is used for long-term projects in a fixed area, like oil drilling or cable laying. A ship deploys an array of transponders on the seabed and calibrates their positions to centimeter-level accuracy. The ship can then use signals from at least three transponders to pinpoint its own location with extreme precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short-baseline method is used to track moving underwater objects, like ROVs. It works in reverse: the ship emits a sound wave, and receivers at three different points on the ship listen for the object&amp;rsquo;s reply, calculating its position for precise control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/21420857a3b343cb98b0c36f1da9cd55.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unmanned survey boat is surprisingly small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/224c1ee48466be3d9aa8f76d2d3c4725.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibit showed the evolution of underwater survey technology. Ancient methods involved lowering a weighted, knotted rope and counting the knots to determine depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/7ce6aa074f21a96694b59c3f61356aa3.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sonar, you can measure the depth along a ship&amp;rsquo;s path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/019d9c97d4b830a964f28c4a268f87e4.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multibeam sonar scans a wide swath at once, creating a full 3D image of the seafloor, not just a line of depth soundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/ee1d346f9a7d8b0db34400b52cf26488.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we land-dwellers have a detailed understanding of the ocean floor. Our maps can even reflect submarine topography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/1ea0767649c92636dd81882c9cd587a2.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also map topography across time. This diagram shows how the coastline of the Zhejiang region has changed over geological eras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="image-based-measurement"&gt;Image-based Measurement
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/7cbf8f1a6900a8f5ea55e1036c498acf.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With modern computer vision and AI, a new path to surveying has opened up: visual measurement, or remote sensing. We capture images and analyze the data within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/242a58277626c3e041068ad5faac824f.webp"

&lt;p&gt;The history of remote sensing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting device showed how aerial drone photos of a city are stitched together. This is the same process used to create the satellite layer in map apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/a58d2e7b454df7ff390efc7103b516f0.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote sensing goes beyond visible light, using infrared, microwave, and other bands to gather richer information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gis-systems"&gt;GIS Systems
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hall was a highlight, showcasing the true power of surveying technology. All the history and techniques discussed so far are about collecting data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are numbers and images the end goal? In data analysis, raw data is useless, no matter how much you have. It must be cleaned, processed, and integrated to derive &lt;strong&gt;meaning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, scattered survey data must be integrated into a system to create a multi-dimensional reconstruction of our world. This is GIS: the Geographic Information System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This board displays one of the earliest applications of GIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-19th century London, during a cholera outbreak, Dr. John Snow (no, not that one) mapped the locations of cases. He noticed they clustered around a specific water pump, allowing him to identify and disable the source of the contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a landmark case in the history of data analysis. I&amp;rsquo;ll recommend a documentary at the end that covers this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interactive screen offered a complete introduction to GIS. I really wanted to explore it, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to save that for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This installation demonstrated GIS for supermarket site selection. Imagine a city wants to build a new public-welfare supermarket. It needs to be on a main road, serve a large population, be near a transport hub, have reasonable rent, and avoid existing competitors. Following the steps, the device filters down to the optimal locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by integrating data on road networks, population, transport hubs, land prices, and property types can such an analysis be performed. This highlights the unique power of GIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a racing game I didn&amp;rsquo;t try. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what aspect of GIS it demonstrated, but it seemed popular with kids—it&amp;rsquo;s all over Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book) posts about the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flood inundation analysis tool demonstrates a value far greater than site selection. It simulates a river basin flood, allowing for rapid assessment of which villages will be affected, enabling time-critical evacuation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see disaster relief news, we see frontline responders and strategic command centers. But behind their rapid response is a robust geographic information database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation&amp;rsquo;s strength is highly correlated with its level of informatization. National power is the ability to mobilize resources, and data&amp;rsquo;s role in that is ever-growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I passed through a dome theater. I caught the 10:40 AM show, a 5-minute film about the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. Unfortunately, it didn&amp;rsquo;t make great use of the dome format; it felt more like a regular video projected on a curved screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of GIS in the power grid can be abstract, so let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take for granted that electricity is always there when we flip a switch. But when you turn on an air conditioner, where does that extra power come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the grid, a natural gas plant might ramp up its output slightly. Or a solar farm might discharge a bit from its battery storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity travels at near light speed. The moment you turn on your AC, it needs that power. How does the plant know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the incredible challenge of a national power grid. The grid must constantly predict load changes and dispatch flexible power sources (hydro, gas, batteries) to match demand in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if supply and demand don&amp;rsquo;t match? The entire grid and all its connected equipment must operate at a precise AC frequency. A significant mismatch causes the frequency to drift, which damages equipment. Damaged equipment destabilizes the frequency further, creating a vicious cycle that can lead to a nationwide blackout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the grid must predict and react to demand changes almost instantly, automatically dispatching power plants. This instantaneous response requires perfect time synchronization across the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where GIS plays a vital, life-or-death role: providing that precise time synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-story-of-maps"&gt;The Story of Maps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last hall on the second floor was dedicated to maps, the product of all this surveying. &amp;ldquo;Viewing the world on a tiny square&amp;rdquo;—the phrase perfectly captures the essence of a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ptolemy&amp;rsquo;s world map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ptolemy is famous for his geocentric model. Modern people, accustomed to the heliocentric model, often see him as a figure of ridicule, but that&amp;rsquo;s a Whiggish perspective to be avoided. Ptolemy actually made enormous contributions to astronomy and geography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In geography, he was a great synthesizer of past knowledge. On his map, he used innovative projection methods and rigorous math to represent the spherical Earth on a flat plane with minimal distortion. It was the most comprehensive and accurate map of its time. He also established a precise latitude and longitude system, correlating Earth&amp;rsquo;s coordinates with those of the celestial sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, his map contained a major error. He underestimated the Earth&amp;rsquo;s circumference by nearly 30% (Eratosthenes&amp;rsquo;s earlier calculation was off by only 2%). He also overestimated the east-west span of Eurasia and was, of course, unaware of the Americas. On his map, it looked like only a narrow sea separated Europe from the Far East. Because of Ptolemy&amp;rsquo;s immense academic influence, his flawed map was taken as gospel and, by a twist of fate, helped inspire the Age of Discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Kunyu Wanguo Quantu&lt;/em&gt; (Map of the Myriad Countries of the World), was drawn in Ming Dynasty Beijing by the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci. It was China&amp;rsquo;s first map with complete longitude and latitude lines and delivered a huge shock to the prevailing Chinese view of a flat earth under a round heaven, with China at the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To soften the blow, Ricci used a clever trick: he shifted the prime meridian to place China and the Pacific Ocean at the center of the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the map appreciation, I came to another section of the map hall, which mainly talked about the various aspects behind maps, such as projection methods, and the relationship between maps and national sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to time constraints, I only snapped a few photos about map projections before leaving in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/e287a2b35de611ac5618089c4f851848.webp"

&lt;p&gt;The most common projection today is the Mercator, shown above. Its problem is that it drastically enlarges high-latitude areas, making Greenland look nearly the size of South America. Comparing a map to a globe makes this distortion obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="afterword"&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left buzzing with excitement. I&amp;rsquo;d truly discovered a hidden treasure. A second visit is definitely in order; there&amp;rsquo;s so much I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to properly appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum&amp;rsquo;s structure is very clear: it starts with the history of surveying, delves into the technology, and ends with the products—GIS and maps. The logical flow is impeccable. It&amp;rsquo;s a very high-quality museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just so low-key. I suspect the name holds it back. But if you&amp;rsquo;ve read this far, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re interested. If you get the chance, go see it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visitor Tips&lt;/strong&gt;: The museum is free but has no parking. You can find street parking a few blocks north, or park at the &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Digital Ecology Innovation Park&lt;/strong&gt;, a 5-10 minute walk away. This park, once Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s closed headquarters, is now an open campus for e-commerce companies. There are no walls or gates. You can park there (for a fee), and the cafeteria is open to the public (though possibly not on weekends). If you want to spend a whole day at the museum, it&amp;rsquo;s a great place to take a lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I recommend the BBC documentary &lt;a class="link" href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/4826804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Maps: Power, Plunder and Possession&lt;/a&gt;. Its topic is highly relevant to the second half of the museum. Watching it beforehand will make your visit even more rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>浙江测绘与地理信息科技博物馆</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/zhejiang-surveying-mapping-and-geoinformation-museum/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 13:33:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/zhejiang-surveying-mapping-and-geoinformation-museum/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0049b42bd1c2729ff1c7646e92e61d5c.webp" alt="Featured image of post 浙江测绘与地理信息科技博物馆" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;意外发现这个非常小众的博物馆，趁着休假，自己去逛了一上午。它是浙江省测绘科学技术研究院的一个附属博物馆，原本期待不高，打算随便看看就出来。去了发现质量出乎意料地高，第一个展厅就让我看得津津有味。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个博物馆有2层楼。1楼几个展厅的主线是中国测绘技术发展史，从古至今。2楼有两个展厅，一个是测绘技术和GIS（地理信息系统）的现代应用，另一个主题围绕地图展开。2楼GIS展厅有很多互动装置，对小朋友们应该挺友好的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一上午时间有限，我尽可能多拍照，回来再细品。但还是只记录下了不到1/3的内容。不管怎样，跟着我粗略云逛一番吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="中国古代测绘"&gt;中国古代测绘
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;第一展厅，古代测绘技术，引出了一个现代人不太会去想的问题：在没有严谨自然科学（尤其几何学）的时代，人们的生活完全是凭感觉来的吗？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;绝对行不通。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人对于世界的感知可以是模糊的、定性的，但一旦要和周围环境互动，免不了有些场合需要精确的、定量的测量。这是物理规律决定的，人不得不服从和利用它。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="垂直方向测绘"&gt;垂直方向测绘
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;比如古人打井，可不是找准地方凭感觉一路挖下去就完了。井的方向必须保持竖直，否则以后打水困难，还容易塌方。他们可以不懂万有引力，但他们能想到利用重物下垂来找到竖直方向。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/4c140fd538d8f1ccccc8028530c77154.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;图里左下尖尖的木头是木垂球，被绳子悬挂在井口圆心，尖头垂直向下。木垂球旁边的大木桩叫木觇（chān）标墩，图里有玻璃反光可能看不太清，它的顶面中央被挖出一个指尖大小的小洞窝。古人挖井过程中，始终让木垂球指向小洞窝中心。井越挖越深，线越放越长，木觇标墩的位置越摆越低。在木垂球和木觇标墩的配合下，井可以保持竖直。就像图里墙上示意图那样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一组简易的装置，是世上最早使用的测量设备。这种挂重物找方向的做法，今天在建筑行业仍然沿用，你肯定听过：铅垂线。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="水平方向测绘"&gt;水平方向测绘
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;三维世界，上下方向有重力很好找，前后左右则不容易做到那么精确。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/90c6604d4a20c66b7145658331fec758.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这时候就需要用到地图。古人在洞穴墙壁上画画可不是在搞艺术，除了反映信仰和生活场面的画，还有极具实用主义的地图。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这幅距今3500年的云南沧源岩画聚落图，反映了村落里房屋、道路的分布，是对物理世界的一种抽象。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再往后逛，你就会越来越意识到，地图是多么伟大的发明。由于人是生活在地表的动物，又不会飞行，我们认识的世界其实近似于一个二维平面。再高的山、再深的谷都无所谓，毕竟人不会钻到土里去或者悬在半空中。这样的世界观，非常利于把人类感知到的世界浓缩到一幅幅平面的画上，忽略高度因素，只看东南西北。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这就是地图，一种从自然界无穷无尽的信息中过滤出关键信息的绝佳工具。部落首领关心自己的村落里哪些地方有房屋，哪些地方有道路，哪些地方养着牛羊，但他一定不关心哪块区域有多少棵树。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="从定性到定量"&gt;从定性到定量
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;不过，沧源岩画聚落图仍然是二维平面的定性表达。看这张图，我们能知道道路的哪个方位有房屋，但无法知道房屋离道路有多远。如果有两栋房屋，也不知道哪个离道路近，哪个更远。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;缺少定量表达会带来什么问题？极其宏观的、无法被人眼丈量的尺度下，人无法做出比较。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人是靠比较来认识世界的，我们不断在用自己熟悉的概念去对比陌生概念。比完了，发现了异同，也就对陌生概念有了一个初步认识。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比如我告诉你地球的赤道周长是4万公里，你不知道有多大。但是我告诉你光如果沿着赤道跑，每秒可以绕地球7.5圈，你就有概念了。光速可是你所知道最快的速度，每秒绕地球圈数竟然只是个位数，那地球对于一个人来说是真的非常大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个7.5，就是一个定量的表达。数字可以相互比较大小，用数学来丈量万物，人就不用再深陷模糊的直观感受里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;数字比大小，要在同样的单位上才能比。一米和一丈谁更长？如果没有换算关系的话，谁也不知道。统一了计量单位，则是让整个国家的的数学语言统一了。没错，数学不是一门纯净的语言，它是有方言的。计算方法是语法，单位就是语音，不同的单位制相当于不同的方言。大家都说同样的数学语言了，楚地和齐地的人就更容易相互做生意，或者合作建长城，让社会资源流动调配起来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/3a57b9e8297d9dd40088913f8f572acd.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在，是不是对秦始皇统一度量衡的意义有了新的认识？不是他主动统一单位有多伟大，而是他打算长期统治如此广阔的地理范围，这件事非做不可。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;图上还反映了一个我从没想过的事实，原来秦朝的官职体系里，管理测绘和地图被作为一项本职工作指派给了某些特定的官职（御史中丞），有专人负责。可见对于国家尺度，测量和统计有多么重要，在这种宏观尺度上，没有任何决策是可以仅凭感觉做出的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;借助统一单位制和测量技术，把巨大的地理范围浓缩到小小平面图上成为可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;马王堆三号汉墓出土的地形图。我把简介从图片上提取出来了：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;长宽各九十六厘米，绘图主区为西汉初长沙国南部，即今湘江上游潇水流域、南岭、九嶷山及附近地区。方位上南下北，主区的比例尺大致在一比十七万至一比十九万之间，经整理、分析、研究证明该图是一幅实测地形图。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/64c6a060c02cfe3c0adc20a0147b3058.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我对湘桂一带地理特征不太了解。注意刚才的地图注解，要把马王堆地图顺时针旋转180度，才能和现代地图比较。2000多年过去了，水系可能发生很大变化，但山川看上去还是挺吻合的。有没有湖南和广西的朋友帮看看这古今对比图，汉人的测绘结果算不算准确？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;early 14c., also &lt;em&gt;gemetrie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gemetry&lt;/em&gt;, from Old French &lt;em&gt;geometrie&lt;/em&gt; (12c., Modern French &lt;em&gt;géométrie&lt;/em&gt;), from Latin &lt;em&gt;geometria&lt;/em&gt;, from Greek &lt;em&gt;geometria&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;measurement of earth or land; &lt;em&gt;geometry&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; from combining form of &lt;em&gt;gē&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;earth, land&amp;rdquo; (see &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/Gaia" title="Etymology, meaning and definition of Gaia"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;) + &lt;em&gt;-metria&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;a measuring of&amp;rdquo; (see &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/-metry" title="Etymology, meaning and definition of -metry"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;-metry&lt;/a&gt;). Old English used &lt;em&gt;eorðcræft&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;earth-craft&amp;rdquo; as a loan-translation of Latin &lt;em&gt;geometria&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;几何学（geometry）这个词，最早的意思可以追溯到古希腊，意思是“测地术”。可以把方形的田地和三角形的田地面积直接对比，让两块田地的主人心服口服。人们从这类实际问题出发，抽象出了这门研究规则和不规则的形状的科学。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中国也同样有人研究几何问题。三国时期的数学家刘徽在给《九章算术》写注时，补了一篇测量海岛高度问题的著作，被后世人命名为《海岛算经》。这其中就系统地运用了相似三角形的原理，实现了不登岛远程测量海岛高度。这是中国第一篇测量相关的数学著作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;测量海岛听起来是个不起眼的事情，但它彻底解放了测量者的人力，让隔空测量远距离大物体成为可能。整个现代天文学发展，处处都用到相似三角形。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/8e1c45738bdc368bb40f24c886bb70b8.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;旁边有个互动装置，详细展示了隔空测量海岛的原理。点击屏幕，可以看到一个古代小人拿着杆子跑来跑去，这里测测那里测测，结果就出来了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;装置上的计算过程可能很多人没耐心看。其中道理我翻译成大白话：杆子随地一插，人倒退几步找地方蹲下，直到看见杆顶和海岛顶端重合。这时候记下人到杆距离，这个距离可以视为海岛通过杆子在地上的投影。另外杆子高度是已知的，于是得到这样一组杆长+影长。但我们只有杆影小三角和海岛大三角的相似关系，算不出具体数字。因为有两个未知量：到海岛距离和海岛高度。一个等式如果有两个未知量，是算不出结果的。没关系，沿着海岛和杆子延长线，找个更远的地方插杆子，前面步骤再来一遍，得到另一组杆长+影长，也就有另一个等式。还要测量两次插杆位置的距离，把两处杆子到海岛距离从两个未知量变成1个未知量，海岛高度则是另一个未知量。用两个等式来算两个未知量，二元一次方程组，不管你会不会算，但大家都知道这是能解的对吧？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是，不仅海岛高度能算出来，距离也一起算出来了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="测量水位运河"&gt;测量水位：运河
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;有了基本的数学原理支撑，哪怕不需要成体系的数学和物理知识，也足够古代人干很多事情了。比如修建全国性的运河。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里有个问题不知道大伙有没有想过：京杭运河南北1700多公里，这一路上水位都是同样高的吗？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这真做不到。沿途各地地形不一样，有的城市建在高地，有的建在洼地。以高地水位来修运河，一漏水就得把洼地城市淹了。若以洼地水位来修运河，修到高地城市附近，得把山都刨通了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/41f210d0f382e6d8f8ff8babc922d509.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以运河的修建是一段一段的，每一段都有独立的水位。以巴拿马运河为例，多层船闸把运河各段隔开，两段中间都会有一小段水位可变的区域。船每走完一段运河，船闸打开，可变区域水位和前一段持平，船开进来。然后关上这边船闸，打开另一边，下一段的水就涌过来，把水位抬高，船就可以进入下一段运河。这样一级一级过来，船就可以在运河中克服各种地形障碍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;细心的朋友可能会发现一个问题：那高水位段的水不是一直在流走吗？每开一轮闸，就流走一些。没错，确实是这样。运河不是一个自给自足、不用维护的系统，它要有外部水源来给高水位段补充水量。如果遇上枯水期，甚至还可能导致运河停运。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/ce5ed44b99341b4c6acac61b1d335cb7.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这么看来，古人修建大运河绝不是咔咔一顿挖那么简单。为了勘测地形，探索合适的修建路径，需要大量的精确测量和计算。元代郭守敬更是首次引入了“海平面”为基准，来衡量对比运河各段水位高度，这是中国首次出现“海拔”的概念。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;补充一个冷知识：大家知道大运河是隋代修建的，但它一开始并不是“京杭”大运河。想想隋朝的首都在哪里？长安，后来又建了东都洛阳。修运河哪有不过首都的？那时候的大运河主干，是以洛阳为中心，北通中原南抵江南，物资汇集于洛阳再运往长安，一切都是为首都服务的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后来，元明清主要在北方经营，长安洛阳的政治地位下降。大量资源被投入到京杭中间的运河修建，这条线才逐渐成为运河的主干。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是我从杭州拱宸桥旁的&lt;strong&gt;运河博物馆&lt;/strong&gt;看来的。感兴趣的话，运河沿线各大城市应该都有运河博物馆，记载着这段历史。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="测量大地子午线"&gt;测量大地：子午线
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;除了测量地上的东西，古人也测量了大地本身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/ce7a4647ce91cc9a0fcd8034e947c6dc.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在世界各古文明中，天和地都是对应的，是相互影响的。唐朝僧人僧一行奉命主持编纂一套更精确的天文历法，来预测天象，进而指导地上的生产生活。他在蒙古到越南之间的极远跨度上设立了13个观测站，命人同时观测北极星高度和正午日影长度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于地球是圆的，站在不同纬度上，看到的北极星（在地球北极上方）离地平线高度不一样，正午时刻太阳投下的影长也不一样。通过这两项数据，他算出了子午线每一度的弧长，达到了当时最高精度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在中国古代概念里，“子”代表正北方，“午”代表正南方，子午线也就是沿着地球表面连接北和南的弧线。今天我们管这个叫经线。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;经线每一度的弧长是个重要数据，它可以进一步算出整个地球有多大。这个发现极有可能掀起探索狂热，继而开启中国的大航海时代。当然，没成是因为缺了另一个关键因素：当时人并没有普遍意识到地球是球形。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="测量天空牵星板"&gt;测量天空：牵星板
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;除了测量地面，古人也测量天空。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/b118e9fef8ec73f7849605189bd7b7c0.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在海上，没有陆地的参照物，辨认方向唯一的办法就是靠天空。白天好办，看太阳，晚上靠什么？月亮是靠不住的，它是地球的卫星，位置比地球还飘。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;古代夜晚航行主要看星星。这得益于一个事实：遥远的恒星相互之间位置不变，它们在天空构成了一幅固定的地图。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;严谨地说，星星的位置并非完全固定，它们自身的运动、地轴进动都在改变它们在天空中的位置。但这些变化因素都太缓慢了，至少要经过几百代人的时间，足以为古人指明方向。而且星星的位置比太阳更稳定，甚至能够提供比白天更多的信息。只是古人需要自己弄明白怎么看这幅星空“地图”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/de8a1e112a8b6583ea2627aa422caee1.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;牵星板是一种测量船只所在纬度的工具，它的观测对象主要是北极星。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/4796ad5682a85b522c4735fbb338c504.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这东西看起来复杂，其实原理非常简单：它这么多块板不是一起用的，一次选一块。每块板都是正方形，没有横竖之分。使用时伸直手臂，让板保持垂直。再微调板的位置，使它下边和海平面重合，如果上边缘刚好和北极星重合，就能知道北极星的高度角。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/93b265f7c295d178ccf6e0974020b81f.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果六指的板刚好和北极星重合，就可以说“北极星六指高”。这个结果可以进一步通过固定的换算表得出所在纬度。这里的“六指”，意思是这块板的边长六指长，一指大约2cm。当然，如果上边缘未与北极星刚好重合，那就换更小或更大的板。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;令人惊讶的是，这样一个技术上简陋的设备，却在郑和下西洋中起到了巨大作用。其实不难发现，这种做法误差可不小。观测者的臂长不同，结果会不同。观测者如果没有让板完全垂直，尤其在晃动的船上，高度角会偏大。但这种原理启发了后续更先进的航海仪器，六分仪。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;巧的是找到一篇&lt;a class="link" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMjg4OTI1OQ==&amp;amp;mid=2247487525&amp;amp;idx=2&amp;amp;sn=870ada9649cf86a215a50f8f08e1174a&amp;amp;chksm=97be6be1a0c9e2f7df6793c00f778eb92fc28ac1fff95732a7c9a7b447356d6ba6c052fa8f47#rd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;博物馆官方公众号的文章&lt;/a&gt;，详细介绍了牵星板的用法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;牵星板六分仪测的都是纬度，经度的测量则要更晚，这是世界古文明共同的航海难题。但为什么只知道纬度就能对航海有巨大帮助？因为只要是前往已知的地方，你查资料就知道起点和终点所在纬度，然后可以先航行到终点的纬度线上，再沿着纬度线一路平着过去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，我怀疑这种方法在群岛国家实用性会下降。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="全国性大范围测量"&gt;全国性大范围测量
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;历朝历代统治者们多少都尝到了精确测量带来的好处，反过来，他们也时不时在全国范围内推行测绘活动。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;元代郭守敬奉命进行全国性的测量，测量范围不亚于僧一行那一次。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;元代为编算新历法，令郭守敬主持了规模空前的四海测验。测量范围南至西沙群岛，北至北极圈附近。郭守敬使用其发明的简仪、高表和景符等新仪器，测出了全国27个地点的纬度值，与现代数值十分接近。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;郭守敬在今河南登封设计建造观星台，整体建筑相当于高表，是中国现存最早的天文台。为提高观测精度，郭守敬发明景符，利用小孔成像原理将影长精确到±2毫米以内。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个就是简仪，说是浑天仪的简化版。看起来可不简单啊，不过它的作用其实非常直接：观测一个星体在天球上的坐标。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;时间关系，简仪没有仔细看。全馆就我一个游客，博物馆工作人员看我东瞧瞧西看看兴致很高，特意上前来提醒我，可以拿出进馆时领的一张白纸，到拓印机上印一张地图留念。有九州山川、西域地图、还有一个什么我忘了。我选了九州山川，效果如下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一问这博物馆有多大，这才知道我只逛了1/5，却用掉了半个上午。后面的参观我都加快脚步，第一眼感兴趣的才驻足研究，其余以拍照为主。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;古代著名学霸，康熙亲自学习并主持了大规模的测量，组织绘制了《皇舆全览图》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;清代康熙帝亲自主持了大规模的经纬度及三角测量，测算出了覆盖全国的641个经纬度点，结合中国长期积累的地理文献资料，用投影法绘制出《皇舆全览图》。这是中国第一部经纬度实测地图，其覆盖面积之大、测绘精度之高、速度之快为当时世界所罕见。期间还最早发现和测绘珠穆朗玛峰、首次发现地球是扁球体的实证，这些都标志着当时中国测绘技术的巨大进步并领先于世界。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于“首次发现地球是扁球体”，我特别查了下。就是因为他的测量点足够多，数据足够丰富，从中发现规律了！大量的子午线一度弧长数据放在一起对比，他们发现高纬度地区的弧长普遍比低纬度地区要长。这意味着地球两极略扁，赤道略鼓。地球的南北直径和赤道直径只差0.33%，这样宏观上微小的差异，只有通过测绘这样的精确手段才能被发现。不过“首次发现”这个表述改为“首次证实”更加严谨，因为扁球体的理论为牛顿首次提出。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是在思考这个问题的时候，我发现了一个矛盾点：为什么&lt;strong&gt;高纬度单位弧长比低纬度长&lt;/strong&gt;可以说明&lt;strong&gt;两极略扁，赤道略鼓&lt;/strong&gt;？这和我的直觉相反啊。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0ae3180f5d50905eccaa0f44b5d71774.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们先把事情极端化一点，假如地球自转速度比现在快很多很多，离心力作用使得地球扁得像个凸透镜。这时候取它横截面，看0-45度的经线长度，明显会比45-90度长很多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为了防止自己被视觉直觉蒙骗，我还做了一番逻辑推导：我们可以把1/4子午线分成90份，每份1度。假设结果为真来反推，&lt;code&gt;…… &amp;lt; 43-44弧长 &amp;lt; 44-45弧长 &amp;lt; 45-46弧长 &amp;lt; 46-47弧长 &amp;lt; ……&lt;/code&gt;，这样类推下去，45以上的每一份，弧长都会大于45以下的任意一份，45以上的总和也一定大于45以下的总和。逻辑上45以上弧长总体一定大于45以下，但刚才的图也严谨精确啊，两个结果冲突，问题出在哪里了？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一番研究发现，是“纬度”的定义问题，一直以来我对纬度的理解是错误的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们习惯了把地球当作正球体来看待，纬线之间都是均匀的。这时，纬度无论用哪种定义，得到的结果是相同的。但面对一个扁球体，纬度的两种常见的定义结果就不同了：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;大地纬度&lt;/strong&gt;：地表法线（垂直线）与赤道平面的夹角，不一定经过球心。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;地心纬度&lt;/strong&gt;：地表地心连线与赤道平面的夹角。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/6dc886a8157b670d8f7534b344daf14f.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大地纬度的45度其实大概在这个位置，冲突就解决了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我以前一直是按地心纬度来理解的，这恰恰是现代人知道太多导致的想当然。其实地理上的纬度是指大地纬度。而且从古人视角看，大地纬度显然比地心纬度更容易理解和测量，这甚至都不需要相信地球是个球。但如果没有球体地球作为观念前提，地心纬度这个概念根本无从谈起。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于纬度的插曲到此为止，回到《皇舆全览图》。博物馆里提供了一个讲解二维码，我没来得及扫，只是先拍了个照。现在把其中的内容识别出来展示给大家，是一段音频：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大地控制网关注地理位置，是三维坐标的准绳。全国各地散布着大量地面测量基准站，就像“米原器”和“千克原器”一样，这些基准站的坐标可以用一系列手段保持其高度精确，其他地方的坐标以它们为基准计算得出。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这其中涉及地面站、卫星实时监测和数据中心计算，即使像板块移动这样微小的因素都能被捕捉到，让这套系统动态更新每个站的真实坐标。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;经典大地原点的模型。中国的大地原点定在陕西省泾阳县永乐镇北横流村。这是上世纪选定的，当时这个位置在中国版图的中央，地质结构也相对稳定。把原点设立在这，利于向四周扩散延伸，让大地控制网覆满全国。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，今天的大地控制网已经不用这种地面位置作为原点了。在现代技术的帮助下，大地原点直接被定义为地球质量中心，与国际标准连通。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/233be0e8b51119d960a8e4e0436c3944.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;高程控制网也类似，定义了大量海拔高度的基准。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/4e6b491bc20622a39684e15df73aa374.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是水准原点模型，是海拔高程的起算点，位于青岛市观象山。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0f4a8ca05149ea32d7c83b58fa1e9082.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有重力的基准点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/df4441616b5e83911c917f780f9fc953.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以及卫星导航定位的基准站网络。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/b98cac1665d1a486d0c6e261487bc68e.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;卫星导航定位基准站。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="基准的应用"&gt;基准的应用
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;定了这些基准，能干什么？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三维空间坐标都测量准确后，我们首次可以做到全国范围的精确分析。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/6ee5c87f9ba2e217d0319da262e2696e.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;胡焕庸线把中国斜着一分为二，两侧对比看，可以发现中国人口分布的明显规律：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中国地理学家胡焕庸在1935年提出划分中国人口密度的对比线，这条线从黑河到腾冲，大致为倾斜45度的直线。按当时的数据统计，线东南方约36%的国土上居住着96%的人口，线西北方约64%的国土居住着4%的人口。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;直至目前，该条人口地域分布的界线依然存在。依据2010年第六次人口普查数据，线东南方约43%的国土居住着94%的人口，线西北方约57%的国土居住着6%的人口。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/e8e497389e7133b3fd640e8332ea7cc6.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;值得注意的是，胡焕庸并不是人为划出了这条线，然后说两侧人口分布有多么不平衡。这不是一个简单的统计学划分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;胡焕庸线是真实存在的地理分界线，线两侧人口落差非常明显，而且这种落差稳定跨越了很长时间。它反映的是中国的地理条件的特征，且与400毫米等降水量线高度重合。季风、水资源、地形地貌、历史路径依赖共同决定了胡焕庸线两侧截然不同的文明形态——农业和畜牧业。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一次全国地理国情普查，弄明白了种植土地的比例构成：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;类型&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;面积 (万平方千米)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;构成比 (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;水田&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;旱地&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;109.52&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;68.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;果园&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11.64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;其他&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;合计&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;159.91&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/6a8e2e5e8f7d8107165e7ea4de17aebc.webp"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还统计了水资源在不同海拔的分布：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;区域&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;面积 (万平方千米)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;构成比 (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;极高海拔区域&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;高海拔区域&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.72&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22.86&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;中海拔区域&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;低海拔区域&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13.43&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;65.04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;合计&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20.65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/f4f85bbcbf3b4e947a0eca891963d348.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不同海拔的植被覆盖：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;区域&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;面积 (万平方千米)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;构成比 (%)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;极高海拔区域&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;37.42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;高海拔区域&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;129.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21.62&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;中海拔区域&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;210.42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;35.26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;低海拔区域&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;219.94&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36.85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;合计&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;596.78&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再后面，还有一块展区详细介绍了珠峰高度的3次测量。最新测量的珠峰高度是8848.86米，到积雪顶部的“雪面高”。这背后故事网上应该很容易查到。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0214a860cc504173697b7707cb162cd3.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;经过了一个很有科幻感的装置，简洁的操作台和异形投影大屏，有点像外星飞船的控制室。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/5b5a063dbd68f4edca19354ad8d79663.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;它其实是个互动装置，反映了测绘数据如何在地震中发挥救灾作用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/9e14b3a9dac5687e3e057bc178e74fab.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;又一个有特点的装置，旋转桶上的大小两个圆盘，可以看到浙江各城市的历史样貌变化。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/cfb6f8c7f78a595b3d058b84a56109ea.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;博物馆1楼的现代部分其实远不止这些东西，但很多我都没拍，尤其是展板和密集的介绍文字。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/52741edf82f2aefffefa42f160e9bb9d.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;即将离开1楼展厅，看到这样两面相对而立的互动墙。伸手触摸墙上的画，对应物体会亮起来，提醒观众，测绘技术作为现代社会的基石之一，对方方面面的影响。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/c5739df0da779e12686464b78c2814e6.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="测绘技术应用"&gt;测绘技术应用
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;来到2楼，展厅内容脱离了技术发展史的逻辑，更加关注技术本身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/9963657c52e26b9c6a2c5f17ee28882c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，还是得带一点历史，作为整个展厅的开场白，展现不同文明不同时期的地理观。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;注意其中的时间顺序，公元前6世纪，地球是球体的理论就被提出来了。甚至再过了2个世纪，已经有许多证据支持这一理论。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公元前六世纪，古希腊人毕达哥拉斯（Pythagoras）提出地球为球形的概念。两个世纪后，亚里士多德（Aristotle）根据月食的球状阴影、天文星象、船只航行等现象进一步论证了地圆说。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然而，再过了近2000年，大多数人仍然相信大地是一个圆盘。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15～17世纪以前，许多欧洲人认为大海是很大的平面，在它的尽头是瀑布。这一认识随着大航海时代的环球航行和地理大发现逐渐被推翻。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可见，一个在后世人看来无可辩驳的理论，在当时人们巨大的认知惯性下，要经过多久才能真正被普遍接受。另一方面，不禁让人畅想，如果古希腊的科学精神从未断绝，我们今天的科技水平能达到怎样的高度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="数值测量"&gt;数值测量
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;当人类知道了地球是个球体，自然就要对它展开测量。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/f0d6c408bea51397250150d71b619f71.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;几个相关但不同的概念。可以这么想象，先把地球当作一个完美的几何椭球体，图上绿色虚线就是它的横截面。但地球表面的硬质地面（包括山脉和海底）则是凹凸不平的，这对应绿色实线。要测量一个位置的垂直高度，以凹凸不平的硬质地面为基准肯定不行。但海平面则是比较准确和均匀的，也就是图中白色实线。由于地球的形状并非完美的椭球体，内部的重力分布也不均匀，所以海平面并不会和标准椭圆重合。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/208cc31d8adf37bc15def1b21aa5e0b0.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;巧的是，我刚好在社交媒体刷到一张NASA发布的大地水准面图。可以让你有个直观感受，基于地球形状和重力分布产生的大地水准面，和一个标准的球体有多大不同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/c15f8ca5c0f1c6b45e7840639e120053.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个装置可以让你感受地形图的绘制过程。借助我们刚才讲的大地水准面概念，把这个面每隔一段距离往上复制一层，形成了许多间隔相同、相互平行的面。这些面与地面所有物体相交，切割产生的边缘线就是等高线。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在沙盘里可以随意改变地形，顶部的投影仪会重新绘制等高线。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0049b42bd1c2729ff1c7646e92e61d5c.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一展区两侧陈列了大量测绘仪器。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/21e4761af32a594f08916793876fd0f9.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/b6c22daa33d1f846e1396b8d91d3bcc2.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看到海洋定位测量，我放慢了脚步。图里表示的是海洋上执行任务常用的两种声学定位方法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;左边的长基线法，通常用在一片固定海域执行长期任务，比如油气开发和铺设管线电缆。船来到这片海域，布下大量应答器作为定位基准，校准它们的位置，误差可达厘米级别。然后这些应答器开始工作，通过至少3个应答器来计算船只的位置，后续的作业便可以在极高的定位精度下完成。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;短基线法更多用来追踪水下移动物体，了解它与船的相对方位与距离，比如水下机器人作业。过程刚好相反，船上发出声波，再从船上3个不同位置接收水下物体发回的声波，算出水下物体的位置，以便对其精确控制。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/21420857a3b343cb98b0c36f1da9cd55.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;水上的无人测量船，其实只有这么点大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/224c1ee48466be3d9aa8f76d2d3c4725.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一组水下地形勘测技术的演进示例。古代的测量方式往往是把带有绳结的绳子绑上重物伸到水底，然后数绳结的个数。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/7ce6aa074f21a96694b59c3f61356aa3.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;通过声纳回声测距，可以测出航行路线各处的深度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/019d9c97d4b830a964f28c4a268f87e4.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;多波束探测则可以同时扫描一大片区域，不止获得深度信息，而是获得一幅立体的三维图景。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/ee1d346f9a7d8b0db34400b52cf26488.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，我们作为一个陆地物种，才能对海洋有如此详细的了解。我们的地图，甚至能反映海底地形变化。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/1ea0767649c92636dd81882c9cd587a2.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不只空间，我们还能知道不同时间上的海陆地形。图里展现的是不同地质年代浙江地区的海陆变化。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="图像测量"&gt;图像测量
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/7cbf8f1a6900a8f5ea55e1036c498acf.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在现代计算机视觉技术（尤其AI）的加持下，出现了一种与数值测量完全不同的测绘路径：视觉测量，也就是我们常说的遥感技术。拍摄画面，然后从图像中分析数据。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/242a58277626c3e041068ad5faac824f.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;遥感测量技术演化史。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/a3b9712fade84f58af0aa4214f9bcc43.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个有意思的装置，向你展示无人机航拍城市实景图，再如何一幅幅拼接起来。地图软件里的卫星图图层，也是这么拼出来的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/a58d2e7b454df7ff390efc7103b516f0.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;遥感技术超出可见光的波段范围，把红外、微波等波段也涵盖进来，可以获得更丰富的信息。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gis系统"&gt;GIS系统
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;这个展厅是博物馆一大亮点，让人真正能见识到测绘技术的威力。前面的发展史也好，技术细节也好，都是在收集数据。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们要的真是这些数字和图像吗？在数据分析领域，未经加工的原始数据，再大的数据量都没有意义。只有经过清洗、加工、整合，满足特定要求，才能从中挖掘出意义。我们要的是那个&lt;strong&gt;意义&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;类似地，测绘收集来的零散数据，被有机地整合到一个系统中，才能从多个维度还原出我们的现实世界。这就是GIS，地理信息系统。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/ce3302313639dc4d03b9c34c39294a12.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这块展板展示了GIS系统最早期的应用之一。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19世纪中，伦敦爆发霍乱，当时人找不到源头。John Snow博士（啊不是大战夜王的那个）想到在地图上把病例标注出来，观察它们的分布。进而发现病例都围绕在一口水井周围，成功地找到并消灭了污染源。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这也是数据分析史上一个很有名的事例。文末我会推荐一部纪录片，里面也提到了这个故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0a869aa79ecef39a6950f2fc93c2898f.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个互动屏幕里面应该比较完整地介绍了GIS系统。我可想看了，只能下次再来了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/163184a12dbbeb524b09d1c0ca9998a3.webp"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个装置展示了GIS系统在超市选址过程中的应用。比如市政府想要建一座惠民超市，要选择城市主干道沿线，覆盖足够多的人口，靠近交通枢纽，租金在合理区间，且避开已有超市的竞争。跟着装置一步一步筛选，最终在城市里找到合适的位置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;只有把路网、人口、交通枢纽、地价、地块属性等各维度信息综合在一起，才能完成这样的分析任务，体现了GIS的独特价值。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2025-07/0b9363c7bf3f60b26072c5a47e7615ad.webp"
loading="lazy"

&lt;p&gt;还有一个赛车游戏，没尝试，不知道会体现GIS哪方面作用。应该很受小朋友欢迎，小红书上搜这个博物馆，出来基本都这个图。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这个淹没分析装置展现出来的价值，比超市选址更重大。它模拟了某流域洪水泛滥，需要快速判断哪些村庄会被水淹，争分夺秒决策疏散相应人口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;平日我们看到的救灾新闻，画面往往是一线人员如何奋力救灾，后方指挥中心如何运筹帷幄。但我们也不要忽略，各方快速响应的背后，是完善的地理信息数据在支撑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个国家的综合实力，和它的信息化程度高度相关。国力就是对于各种社会资源的动员能力，数据在其中发挥的作用只会越来越大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接下来会穿过一个球幕影厅。上午10:40赶上了一场球幕电影，大概片长5分钟吧，主要是北斗系统的介绍片。不足的是这个片子没有很好发挥出球幕的优势，除了画面中央主体物外，周围空间没有很好利用起来，更像是一个普通视频。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这一系列展板从比较宏观的角度展示了GIS在各民生领域的应用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中GIS在电力系统发挥的作用可能有点抽象，大多数人不理解，我展开讲讲。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们平时习惯了一接上电源、打开开关就有电，觉得理所当然。但有没有想过，你多开一个空调，多用的这一部分电，是谁发给你的？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没错，在电网的另一端，某个天然气发电厂很有可能开大了一点点功率。或者某个带储能的光伏电站，把储能电池调大了一点输出来支援你。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;电是以光速传播的，你打开空调的那一瞬间，你的空调立马就需要这些电。另一头的发电厂是怎么知道的呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这就是电网的难处了，像中国这种规模的全国性电网，调度之难是不可想象的。电网必须能准确预测用户侧的用电负载变化，及时调度水电、燃气发电、储能这类灵活电力来匹配用电需求。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;匹配不上会怎样？电网和它的所有发电设备，都必须严格在一个固定的交流电频率上工作。发电量如果显著大于或小于用电量，频率就会明显上升或下降，这会反过来损坏发电设备。发电设备损坏使得电网频率更加不稳定，把更多设备拖垮，恶性循环，导致全国性的大停电。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，电网必须极其精准地预测和应对用户端的用电量变化，几乎瞬时地发出指令，自动化调度发电厂来匹配用电需求。这种瞬时的响应，自然要求电力供需双方的时间高度一致。否则等供电量慢慢爬上来，黄花菜都凉了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这就是GIS发挥作用的地方，精确同步各方的时间。看似一件小事，但生死攸关。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;托勒密的世界地图。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;托勒密最知名的是他的地心说。习惯了日心说的现代人，很多会用一种批判的眼光来看他。但这种辉格主义是要不得的，托勒密对于天文地理的发展其实做出了极大的贡献。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在地理方面，他可以说是前人研究成果的集大成者。在托勒密的这幅地图上，他采用了创新的投影方式和严谨的数学方法，把地球的球形表面以很小的形变程度，投影在了地图平面上，是当时最全最准确的地图。而且他还建立了精密的经纬度系统，精确地把地球经纬度与天球的经纬度对上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;更好玩的是，他的地图有重大错误。他对地球周长的估算，反而不如更早的埃拉托色尼的计算结果，低估了近30%（埃拉托色尼误差约2%）。同时他还高估了欧亚大陆的东西跨度，忽略了当时不知道的美洲的存在。在这幅地图上，看上去从欧洲到远东只要经过一片窄窄的海域。由于托勒密在当时的学术影响力，他这份错误的地图反被奉为圭臬，阴差阳错开启了大航海时代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;坤舆万国全图，由意大利传教士利玛窦在明朝北京绘制，也是中国最早的有完整经纬线的地图。对当时中国天圆地方、以中国为中心的地理观带来了巨大冲击。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;利玛窦为了降低明朝人的抗拒心理，也用了点小心思。他整体移动了子午线位置，把中国和太平洋置于画面中央。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;现代最常见的是墨卡托投影，就是上图的样子。墨卡托投影的问题是高纬度地区会被放得很大，使得格陵兰岛看起来快赶上南美洲大小了。其实对比地图和地球仪就很容易发现这个问题。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;逛完出来，兴致满满。真是发现了一个宝藏博物馆，二刷是肯定要的，很多东西都还没来得及仔细品味。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整个博物馆的脉络比较清晰。先从测绘发展史讲起，然后详细展开测绘技术本身，再是测绘的产物，GIS和地图。逻辑严谨环环相扣，我认为是一座质量非常高的博物馆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就是实在太低调了，怀疑是被这名字耽误了。但是不管怎么样，如果你已经一路读到了这里，相信你是感兴趣的，方便的话就亲自去看看吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;游玩提示&lt;/strong&gt;：博物馆免费，但不提供停车位。博物馆北边的几条街能找到一些路边停车位，或者再往北过两条街停到&lt;strong&gt;阿里巴巴数字生态创新园&lt;/strong&gt;，距离博物馆步行5-10分钟。这个园区原先是阿里巴巴总部的封闭办公园区，后来开放给电商和阿里生态企业入驻，成了一个开放园区。没有围墙，没有门禁。这里不仅可以停车（收费），食堂也接待社会人员（周末可能没有）。如果想在这博物馆细细品味一整天，中午可以来这里歇歇脚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这个发现在提醒我，最宝贵的究竟是什么——时间。一生30000多天，区区一个五位数，能大到哪去？30000元百元纸币，连一个电脑包都装不满。如果把人生30000多天想象成一张折线图，横轴是时间的流逝，纵轴是个人的能力。当我忙忙碌碌一整天，把按钮、输入框在画板里复制来复制去，摆放，对齐，我当天的图表就画出一条水平的横线，像死气沉沉的心电图。Bullshit job多做一日，人生就停滞不前一天。只有尽可能让图表更多地上扬，才能在有限时间成就更有意义的事，才有机会在未来打开局面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然而需要警惕的是，多数时候，曲线上扬与企业的目标背道而驰。老板喜欢量化，喜欢看得见的东西。到了老板这个层次，都会用财务的视角看问题，因为数字实实在在，让人安心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;员工运用已掌握的能力去完成一项任务，可视为生产活动，能带来直接的在产品或产成品。企业为生产活动支付的成本属于营业成本，能直接转化为营收。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;员工如果去做一些不在计划内的事，可视为研发活动，即使对未来有帮助，也未必能兑现。企业为研发活动支付的成本属于管理费用，是利润表上的负担。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在企业生存艰难时，这种趋势愈发明显。宁可驱使员工钝刀砍柴，也不肯让他们停下来磨磨刀。毕竟，砍柴也总有货物产出，令人安心。而一个员工自我成长到什么程度，有多少能反过来帮助企业成长，老板心里没底。老板的这个难处，我能理解。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但作为员工，要保持清醒，你的利益和老板是不一致的。老板即使给你机会，他也不是要你成长为另一个老板，而是一个能使电锯、能开伐木机的伐木工。老板他只是人生中的一个过客，一个普通人。除了自己，没有人会为你的未来负责。如果工作不再能使人生曲线上扬，必须要自己创造机会。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近深陷在给PPT找配图、替换配图的工作里，曲线横了很长时间了。我甚至想象了一下，如果我是大老板，知道自己花这个薪水招来的人天天在干这种事情，我要么把这个人开了，要么把给他派活的人开了。但是，老板的利益我并不在乎，我关心的是为自己的成长划出保护区。今天起，无论活有多少，都不能让它挤占我午休的时间，挤占我因为送小孩而早到公司的时间。这些时间可以好好利用起来：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;看育儿书，让自己成为更好的家长&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;重新拾起我对自然科学的兴趣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;保持英语的接触与运用&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;学习数据科学&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;至于堆积在那儿的一众杂活，晚一点或者糙一点又如何，总有技巧可以让对方接受，天塌不下来。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>种牙</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3636/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 17:41:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3636/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;第一次种牙。从躺上手术台到做完下来，全程大概30分钟，还蛮快的。也是第一次做局部麻醉手术，意外的是，连打麻药的那一下都不觉得疼，一根针管戳到牙龈里，什么感觉也没有。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开始前给我盖了块布，只露出一张嘴。在手术台上，我想象自己不是一个人，而是可以用语音控制的一副牙。在医生看来，可不就是如此嘛！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于眼睛被遮住了，我干脆闭眼休息，感受嘴里的各种动静，猜测现在是在做什么。比较确定的是吸管吸血水和缝针，其他的操作不太分得清，麻药劲儿大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;医生一边做手术，一边给旁边的年轻医生讲解。那些医学术语，我只能说……每个字我都能听懂。有时他们又开始吐槽医院后勤，老是把不同医生的器材搞混。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的牙算是比较棘手的。张嘴检查时，医生就罗列了一大堆困难，空间小了，软组织不够了，牙龈不够了，等等。我搞不懂手术细节，但听讲解大概知道，医生全程都在努力见招拆招想办法解决问题。虽然身体不由自主绷得笔直，但心里很安心。没有人是全知的，每个专业领域都深似海，对他人专业能力的信任构成了这个社会的基础。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从医院开药出来，带着几种消炎药，还有一种止痛药。没给塑料袋，手上一摞瓶瓶罐罐。形形色色的人在医院进进出出，我在他们当中，和每个人一样，向着自己的下一站走去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一刻，我忽然感觉从过去大半年的科技狂潮中醒来，重回现实世界。无论有没有交集，每个人构成了彼此的生活，其中细节无比丰富，妙趣横生。这才是我的生活。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When Confidence Outpaces Competence</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3635/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 13:42:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3635/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Typically, confidence grows alongside competence, and often lags behind it. You need a solid foundation of skills before feeling confident. But sometimes, your confidence outstrips your competence, making you fearless in new situations. I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced this twice since graduating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a few years back, I took adult spoken English classes at New Oriental. It was awesome. My English education in school was decent, giving me a good base. I passed CET-6 in college without studying, scoring 504. But test scores don&amp;rsquo;t equal confidence. I mostly used Chinese, and my English was limited to reading and writing. Reading English news felt like a major undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At New Oriental, I spent over six months chatting with teachers and classmates in English, covering all sorts of topics. Most of the grammar was review, and I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten much of the vocabulary. I probably haven&amp;rsquo;t retained much of the actual English learned. However, my confidence skyrocketed. I could effortlessly type in English to search for information and read long articles without feeling overwhelmed. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t about understanding everything perfectly; I still needed a dictionary, but it felt natural. As a direct result, my English improved significantly after the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, when I started working with AI. My coding skills were mediocre. I&amp;rsquo;m a designer, not a coder. At a friend&amp;rsquo;s suggestion, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (though my JavaScript was basic) to build my website. Once the site was live, I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider using code for other problems. I&amp;rsquo;d search for existing tools, and if none existed, I&amp;rsquo;d give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning basic Python with AI&amp;rsquo;s help, my confidence soared again. I became bolder. Now, when facing a problem, my first thought is often: &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s write a program with AI to solve this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I was organizing prompt words for AI image generation. I have categorized notes. Terms like &amp;ldquo;knolling,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;isometric drawing,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dutch shot&amp;rdquo; describe specific effects, which are key for getting the desired results from AI. But sometimes, I want a visual comparison of these effects. This meant searching for each term individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I tackled this. The goal: combine the terms, separated by commas, and with one click, open multiple browser tabs for image searches of each term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AI&amp;rsquo;s assistance, I wrote a working script in 2 minutes. Another 10 minutes went into refining it, handling edge cases, and improving extensibility. From problem to solution, it took under 15 minutes. Crucially, this was outside my competence zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your confidence exceeds your competence, your skills quickly catch up, because knowledge and action are intertwined. In learning, building confidence is more vital than the amount learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting time to be alive. There are countless ways to boost your confidence beyond your competence and solve real-world problems. I&amp;rsquo;m not just referring to AI; seeking professional help or even purchasing services (with careful selection) can work, provided you&amp;rsquo;re willing to take that initial step.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>当自信突破能力圈</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3635/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 13:42:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3635/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;自信通常是随着能力圈扩大而扩大的，而且自信圈的范围通常小一些，得是你能力圈足够大之后，才会在内部形成一个较小的自信圈。但有些情况下，自信圈会生长到能力圈之外，让你不惧怕陌生的领域。从毕业以来，我有两次遇到了这种情况：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一次是前几年在新东方学成人口语，很快乐的一段经历。我的中学英语教育见长，导致我英语的基础本身就还可以。举个例子，大学英语六级，没做准备，抱着盲考心态一次通过，504分。但是考试成绩并不能给人建立自信圈，我长期都在接收中文世界的信息，会的也只是哑巴英语。英语新闻有闲暇才读，读之前总是正襟危坐，感觉要做一件什么大事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去新东方和中国老师、外国老师和同学用英语聊了大半年的天，天南海北地侃。课本上的语法其实大部分是学生时代学过的，当时学会的生词，现在也忘得差不多了。如果要说实际的英语水平提升，到今天可能也没留下多少。但是经历了这么一段，我的信心圈一下子扩大到能力圈的外面，需要查资料、搜新闻的时候，我可以毫无顾忌的直接输入英语，然后毫无心理负担地阅读英语长文。不是说我可以轻松读懂，我也需要配合词典，但这么做感觉很自然。一个直接的结果就是，英语水平真正突飞猛进，恰恰是新东方毕业之后才开始。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二次就是学会调遣AI。以前，我的写代码水平也就那样，毕竟我是个设计师，也不是职业开发人员。在朋友的怂恿下，为了给自己搭建个人网站，自己学会了web前端三件套：HTML、CSS和JavaScript，其中JavaScript的掌握比较肤浅。个人网站做出来后，也从来没想过用代码能力去解决其他问题。遇到问题都是找现成的工具来解决，找不到就不解决。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在AI的帮助下学会了Python基础之后，信心圈再次扩大到能力圈之外，说白了就是胆儿肥了。现在遇到问题，我第一反应往往是：要不和AI合作写个程序来解决吧！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天在整理AI画图用的提示词，我自己做了一篇笔记分门别类收藏。里面很多诸如knolling, isometric drawing, dutch shot这样描述具体效果的词，这是让AI准确产出所需效果的关键。但有时我也想把其中几种效果相互对比，直观感受每种效果的样子，看看具体画面如何，这就得把这些词一个个拿到搜索引擎里去图片搜索。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天决定解决这个问题。想达到的效果是，把要对比的词放到一起，用逗号隔开，然后一键操作，直接打开多个浏览器标签页，对这几个词分别做图片搜索。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;跟AI合作，2分钟写出了一个能用的脚本。再额外花了10分钟，完善一下特殊情况的处理，并让脚本更有扩展性。从意识到问题到实际解决解决，不到15分钟。关键是，这是我能力圈外的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;信心圈如果扩展到能力圈之外，能力圈很快也会跟上来，毕竟知行合一。所以，学任何东西，建立信心真的比学到了什么程度重要。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在是个很好的时代，有太多办法可以让你的信心圈扩展到能力圈之外，还能解决实际问题。我说的不只是AI，敢于请专业人士帮忙也行，甚至淘宝买专业服务也可以（但需要甄别），只要你愿意迈出这一步。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My Daughter's New Game and Topology</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3630/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 23:05:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3630/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2023-01/IMG_20230125_205204.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My Daughter's New Game and Topology" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2023-01/IMG_20230125_205204.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered a new game, and my daughter is obsessed. I push a bottle into one end of a massage roller, and it slides out the other, landing in front of her. She soon joins in, picking up the bottle and pushing it back through. I lift the roller, give it a spin to change the bottle&amp;rsquo;s direction, and let it drop before her again. She giggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds, she grabs the roller and peers inside. From the other end, I keep taking the bottle and returning it. I also flick the bottle, making it jump towards her inside the tube. She squeals with laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking: maybe tube shapes are uncommon for babies, both now and for babies in prehistoric times. Topologically speaking (that branch of math about counting holes), most toys and dishes she sees are basically discs. Only a few, like instant noodle bowls with handles, are topologically donuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To her, a disc is closed. Things just pass by. But with a donut shape, things can move two ways: passing by or going &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the hole. Going through, to her, means interacting – entering and exiting. The tube&amp;rsquo;s larger internal space makes this even more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottle disappearing and reappearing probably seems magical. After grabbing the roller, she might&amp;rsquo;ve sensed the magic of this shape with a hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, full disclosure: I&amp;rsquo;m probably overthinking the math. Maybe she just likes the bottle, hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>女儿的新游戏与拓扑学</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3630/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 23:05:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3630/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2023-01/IMG_20230125_205204.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 女儿的新游戏与拓扑学" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2023-01/IMG_20230125_205204.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;发现一个新游戏，女儿玩得不亦乐乎。把饮料瓶从按摩滚筒的一头塞进去，再从另一头滑出来，掉在她面前。玩着玩着女儿开始参与游戏，她主动把饮料瓶捡起来，从滚筒那一头又塞进来。我举起滚筒在空中转几圈，让饮料瓶调个方向，再掉在她面前，宝贝看着我咯咯笑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好多个回合之后，女儿把滚筒抱过去，探头对着里面瞧。我从另一头一会儿把饮料瓶拿走，一会儿又塞回去。还用手指弹饮料瓶，好让它在桶里向着女儿那头跳起来。宝贝笑出鹅叫。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想了想原因，可能桶形对于小宝贝来说是个很少见的形状，无论是对于现代宝贝，还是对史前的智人幼崽。从拓扑学来看，也就是那个数洞洞的学问，宝贝在生活中接触到的绝大多数玩具与锅碗瓢盆，都可以用拓扑学抽象成圆饼状。只有少数如带把儿的泡面碗，才能被抽象成甜甜圈形。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;圆饼形对于宝贝来说，是个封闭物体，其他物体只能从旁边掠过，看起来与它没有任何关联。而对于拓扑为甜甜圈的物体，其他物体有2种移动模式：从旁边掠过和从洞中穿过。穿过时，在宝贝看来就是进入了物体内部，又从里面出来，两个物体发生了互动。尤其是桶形的内部空间比较大，这种感受更明显。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;饮料瓶短暂消失在滚筒里，又从滚筒另一边重新出现，对她来说可能就像变戏法一样。把滚筒抱过去之后，她也许感受到了这种有两个开口的形状的神奇。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，既然你都看到这里了，我得承认我就是在数学鬼扯。可能她只是喜欢这个饮料瓶而已哈哈哈哈。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>感染奥密克戎的两周</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3626/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 23:04:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3626/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;记录一下这两周我经历了什么。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022年12月中旬，杭州全面放开了疫情防控。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="始于女儿高烧"&gt;始于女儿高烧
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;12月16日，星期五，女儿最先出现症状，当晚半夜高烧到39度左右。周四刚刚带女儿去社区医院打过疫苗，觉得可能是在医院染上了流感。半夜给她物理降温，打一盆热水反复擦脖子、大腿、胳肢窝，只降到了38度上下。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二天，星期六，两个大人也开始发烧。当晚，女儿又重新烧到39度左右。先坚持物理降温，从凌晨3点忙到4点半，效果不明显。拿出泰诺林喂了1mL，终于又降到38度左右。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在接下来的时间里，康复指南上的所有症状，发烧、肌肉酸痛、刀片嗓等，一家三口一个不落全都来了一遍。当然，宝贝不会说话，有些症状比如刀片嗓，我们也无法确定她有还是没有。但有几天里，她喝奶每喝几口就要哇哇大哭，大概率也是中了吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="全家病倒"&gt;全家病倒
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;艰难的第三天来了，星期日。当天决定3人拖着病躯出门一趟，有好几件事要办：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;去医院把缺的药配上，尤其是宝宝的退烧药。家里的泰诺林效果不明显。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;去两个大人的公司取一下工作资料。尤其是我公司下周就要搬家，私人物品得提前带走，防止下周居家隔离，不能去公司整理。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;弄清楚到底是不是感染新冠。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大人的药已经什么也买不到了，好在买到了宝宝的美林，后来证明它退烧效果确实更好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于此时到处都买不到抗原，同时家周边单管的核酸采样点已经撤得只剩一家医院了。跑去一看队伍老长，宝宝和妈妈在车里等不起，决定直接回家，在小区做混管。不出所料，混管疑似阳性。其实也不用疑似了，所有症状都对上，那个一定是我了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;傍晚做完核酸顺便采购点生活物资，发现两个菜店已经空空荡荡。赶紧再掏出山姆会员和各种电商应用，才意识到物资和物流竟已如此紧张。一边回忆着九成感染者无症状的鬼话，一边把仅剩的一些菜往袋里装。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;到家见到令人心碎的一幕。女儿在游戏围栏内一边哭着一边玩，妈妈裹着毯子蜷在围栏一角一动不动。她事后描述，连手指头都在疼。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们俩这时已经吃过布洛芬有一段时间了，妈妈这边还没起效。好在我起效很快，人感觉轻快不少，硬熬着把事情做完，三人饭吃完进房休息。这天宝宝仍然高烧，放弃物理降温，直接用美林，整晚体温控制在发烧边缘。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="大人的噩梦"&gt;大人的噩梦
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;后续，女儿的病情逐渐好转，症状也在几天内只剩咳嗽。大人的噩梦刚刚开始。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于生病难受，女儿变得异常粘人，每天醒着的时间可能有一半得抱着，剩下一半时间旁边也得有人陪着。所以我俩常常忙到实在忍不住了，才停下手上的事去上厕所。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;女儿作息全乱了套。白天几乎睡到中午，奶和辅食直接就略过了一顿，醒来后精神萎靡又不怎么睡。夜晚一两点醒来在我们身上爬来爬去，一爬就是半小时，爬着爬着还会哭起来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;夜里女儿对我们的影响其实并不止那半小时。半小时内，我们有时候拍拍，有时候还需要妈妈抱起来哄，基本都不管用。如果由她去，她制造的每一点动静，都在刺激我产生更多肾上腺素，肌肉也会不受控制地紧绷起来。后果就是身体发热，即使女儿睡着了，我还会翻来覆去一个多小时，翻到床垫烫得像平底锅，需要每隔一段时间掀开被子来散热。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同时妈妈由于休息不好，加上吸奶的规律也乱了，母乳量直接减半。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;托班因为老师中招也停摆了，元旦后才复课，确实是个黑暗的局面。这两个多星期里，我们泡奶、做辅食、喂饭、换尿片、哄睡、洗衣服、洗碗、消毒奶瓶、做自己的饭、收拾餐桌、抢生活物资、往返快递驿站、买菜、偶尔打扫地面，没有一天好好休息过。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有一天因为女儿玩心太重一瓶奶喝了半小时，我背已经疼到直不起来了，狠狠地把她放进婴儿车里，她吓得哇哇哭。事后真的后悔，女儿最难受的几天里，玩着玩着总往爸爸妈妈身上钻，脑袋搁在我们腿上休息。而我最难受的时候，却辜负了她毫无保留的信任。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;控制情绪不是靠克制，是要换位思考，尤其是在如此艰难的情况下。我从女儿身上学到的，只是还远远没学到位。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外，奥密克戎的嗅觉失灵和味觉失灵也出现了，爸妈各占了一个，我领到的是嗅觉失灵。本来觉得嗅觉这感官也没那么重要，失灵半个月能有多大问题？事实证明很多事情都是关联的，我想简单了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以前我鼻子很灵，总能第一时间闻到女儿拉便便。现在常常是女儿拉了一大堆，又滚来滚去滚得满身都是，我才发现。于是一天中又有许多时间要用来手洗衣服，一次还搓不干净，得用强力去污的产品泡起来再洗一遍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="生活的补刀"&gt;生活的补刀
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;祸不单行，很多和疫情不相关的事情也来补刀。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;家里干衣机坏了。宝宝衣服因为大便换得勤，大人衣服也因为夜里身体忽冷忽热而汗湿，我们只好一件件晾在主卧电暖器上方。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;洗碗机坏了。不是全坏，是操作面板没反应了，没法切换到洗菜档，只能用默认的洗碗档。洗碗档水温非常高，用来洗叶子菜就废了。于是我们都是一片片手洗的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;时钟坏了。每次想看看女儿离上次吃饭、换尿片有多久，抬头看到的总是凌晨时分。换了好几个电池才终于确认钟坏了。但习惯很难改变过来，仍然会去看钟，然后再叹口气去拿手机。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就连单元楼两部电梯也坏掉一部。防疫放开前刚好坏掉，维修人员和物资一直到不了位，就这样坏了两个多星期。我家这种中间楼层，下楼买菜时，经常要在电梯间等它从顶楼跑到1楼，再回来接我。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="生活的回马枪"&gt;生活的回马枪
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;随着感染进入后半程，女儿症状早早都消失了，两个大人也在逐渐好转，剩下的症状还有咳嗽多痰多鼻涕。满怀希望时，又被杀了个回马枪。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;某天我吃饼干，后槽牙被崩掉了一小块。不太确定是原本完好的牙齿坏了，还是补牙的材料掉了，我的牙齿修修补补过不少地方。当天冲牙刷牙就开始感觉牙神经有反应，只好先尽量不去碰它。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但我不想碰它，偏不行。隔日，就正对着这坏牙的位置，牙龈和腮帮子整个都发炎了。半张脸肉眼可见地肿起来，腮帮子里还有个硬块。肿起的部位24小时挤压着牙神经，一边是肿脸糊在坏牙上磨来磨去，一边是牙齿避无可避咬着腮帮子。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;忍着牙齿二连击，打开手机查看消息。堆积着各种会议邀请、未接来电、同事催我干活的留言。看到这里我忽然就忍不住了，背对着老婆，摘下眼镜，抽了一张纸擦擦双眼。不过即使隔着我半边肿脸，她还是发现了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一刻我心里想的是：我这样的人，到底是不配有孩子，还是不配有工作？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，事情还没完。脸略微消肿后我又重新开始发烧，这回轮到我蜷缩在女儿的游戏围栏里了。好在老婆的病情一直在好转，没有出现反复，后半程几乎都是她在照顾家。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;生活这就罢手了吗？还没有。先是出现了一丝希望，托班应很多双职工家长要求，在临近元旦时提前复课了，唯一要求是家里抗原检测阴性。但我们连测了好多天，都没有转阴。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好不容易把孩子送去托班了。下课开车去接女儿，接到之后发现车怎么都发动不了，身上还发着冷的我，一下子就急出一身汗。女儿一边哭闹着想睡觉，反复尝试无果，先打车带她回家。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回家路上在想，哪里出问题了。想到可能是车钥匙电池没电，因为点火时车总说检测不到钥匙。回家换了电池，立马再打车折返。所幸真是这个原因，成功把车开回家，反复熄火启动了几次，确认了车没坏。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="曙光"&gt;曙光
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;经历了这么多，在老婆的建议下买了两注彩票。不出所料，生活不允许我用这种投机的方式翻盘。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;病去如抽丝。我家的疫情还没有真正过去，我现在仍然咳起来躬得像只待宰的虾。但明天就是元旦假期，再坚持三天，生活终归要回归正常。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;圣诞节那天，老婆很有心地提前准备了全家的圣诞套装，我们一家三口对着镜头唱唱跳跳。在一张照片里，女儿满脸严肃，眼神坚定，好像在说：爸爸挺住！我们跟它们拼了！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没错，孩子和工作，我两个都有。不好意思，这就是我的本事。生活你要是还看我不爽，我就在这，随时奉陪。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>传统菜场笑到最后</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3624/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 23:09:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3624/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;我家楼下原本有3家店可以买菜：一家叫盒马邻里，盒马配送的暂存点；一家叫明康汇，所谓互联网思维的新型生鲜业态，店里和711一样干净明快，还卖部分预制菜和糕点，晚上8点开始，折扣力度随时间推移越来越大，号称每天不剩菜；还有一家叫勾庄水果蔬菜直销，听名字大概你们就知道是什么样的店。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;死贵死贵的盒马邻里，开业以来基本无人问津，用来暂存的冰柜、鱼缸常年是空着的。扛了一年左右，嗝屁了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明康汇打折很吸引人，生鲜品质还挺高，经常造成勾庄那边无人问津的场面，一度给对方带来巨大经营压力。但是它这装修、这菜品质，和勾庄的散装菜价格竟然不相上下，我很怀疑它的利润率。果然，今天发现它那个商铺忽然变成了一家药店。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;笑到最后的，还是传统菜场。不用扯什么互联网赋能供应链，没谁能比熟门熟路的菜贩小两口更能控制成本。人家是用自己的起早贪黑亲力亲为换来的低成本，甚至买只鸡你让他们把皮扒干净都没问题，这不是写个程序、搭个信息化平台能比的。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zhejiang Museum of Natural History Anji</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3617/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 10:48:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3617/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_125734.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Zhejiang Museum of Natural History Anji" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently visited the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History&amp;rsquo;s Anji branch, a place I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to check out. It&amp;rsquo;s located in Anji County, Huzhou, about an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive from Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted for the afternoon session (12 PM - 4 PM), which is longer. But for a museum enthusiast like myself, time flies. Four hours for six halls means prioritizing – you can&amp;rsquo;t see everything in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommended order is: Geology, Behring, Ocean, Natural Art, Dinosaur, and Ecology. Being my first visit, I moved quickly, took fewer pictures, and focused on the exhibit texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="geology-hall"&gt;Geology Hall
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction is striking: a spherical screen displays Earth&amp;rsquo;s 4.6-billion-year evolution. Surrounding it, small exhibits showcase rocks and meteorites – granite, metamorphic, sedimentary, even meteorites from Mars and the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Earth&amp;rsquo;s history, the intro&amp;rsquo;s brilliance is clear: 4.6 billion years of dramatic change, with life somehow emerging in a volatile environment. From there, the epic of life&amp;rsquo;s evolution unfolds in the following six halls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introductory video is surprisingly detailed, covering major geological events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowball Earth: A massive global ice age. Expanding glaciers reflected sunlight, reducing heat absorption and creating a feedback loop that froze the entire planet. The photo depicts volcanic activity, caused by crustal movement, which reversed this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_121129.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snowball Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pangaea: The second instance of all continental plates merging into a supercontinent. Pangaea&amp;rsquo;s center, far from oceans, became vast Gobi deserts – the video is quite realistic. Pangaea eventually broke apart, forming today&amp;rsquo;s continents and oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_120623.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pangaea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East African Rift Valley: Crustal movement is separating the African and Arabian plates, creating a rift valley spanning East Africa. Notably, our human ancestors would eventually emerge from this region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_120802.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;East African Rift Valley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geology Hall&amp;rsquo;s central theme is the geological time scale. Everything pre-Cambrian is grouped as Precambrian. Subsequent periods each have displays of equal size and format, showcasing typical life and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest initially skipping the displays on the opposite side of the corridor. Focus on the main displays along one side – the hall&amp;rsquo;s core. Familiarity with evolution and taxonomy enhances the &amp;ldquo;epic of life&amp;rdquo; experience: primordial life in the oceans, the Cambrian explosion, Devonian plants conquering land, amphibians emerging, Mesozoic reptile dominance, and mammal takeover after the dinosaur extinction. It&amp;rsquo;s a whirlwind tour of life&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_122741.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambrian Display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t overlook the small globes beside the displays. Each shows the continental distribution of that period. Unfortunately, they&amp;rsquo;re positioned too low; even for children, the ocean dominates the view. You need to crouch to see the landmasses, discouraging interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_124135.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cretaceous Display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The displays are exceptionally well-crafted. Plant specialists might spot small yellow flowers from the Cretaceous onward, aligning with the prevailing theory of angiosperm (flowering plant) origin in that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_124141.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cretaceous Display - Small Yellow Flowers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After experiencing the main timeline, return to the hall entrance and explore the other side. As the &lt;strong&gt;Zhejiang&lt;/strong&gt; Museum of Natural History, the geology section highlights Zhejiang&amp;rsquo;s history and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_121427.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhejiang formed from the merging of two landmasses. Check your map app&amp;rsquo;s terrain view to see the rift valley in western Zhejiang&amp;rsquo;s hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_121442.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodinia: A supercontinent, like Pangaea, where landmasses were joined. Rodinia existed much earlier than Pangaea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_121722.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rodinia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_121834.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evidence of Glacial Movement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Snowball Earth? The discovery of tillite was key to proving such extensive glaciation. The principle resembles these scratches, but is more definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillite forms from slow-moving glaciers. The immense force scrapes up various rocks, incorporates them into the glacier, and crushes them. Disparate rocks become tightly compacted. When unearthed, geologists recognize glacial action as the only explanation. Tillite&amp;rsquo;s global distribution proves past global glaciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_122130.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Golden Spike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display&amp;rsquo;s explanation is concise. Let me expand on Golden Spikes. They&amp;rsquo;re essentially standards for demarcating geological ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth&amp;rsquo;s 4.6-billion-year history requires division into periods, similar to China&amp;rsquo;s dynasties. Given the vast timescale, multiple divisions are needed. The Qing Dynasty is subdivided into Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Daoguang. Geology uses six levels, from largest to smallest. The most familiar are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proterozoic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paleozoic (The names of first four periods come from British locations where corresponding strata were initially discovered)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cambrian (Explosion of life, appearance of mollusks and arthropods)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordovician (Appearance of chordates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silurian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devonian (Fish dominated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carboniferous (Plants with lignin grew tall. Bacteria and fungi to decompose it hadn&amp;rsquo;t evolved, so buried wood formed thick coal seams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mesozoic
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triassic (Dinosaurs emerged)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jurassic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cretaceous (Dinosaur extinction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cenozoic (Mammals rose)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quaternary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are Golden Spikes? They&amp;rsquo;re based on fossils of specific, representative species. These species, distinct from predecessors and reflecting major environmental shifts, mark the boundaries between geological ages. Organisms are markers; they divide geological time.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall features numerous interactive displays. If interested, you can explore them for a deeper understanding of the hall&amp;rsquo;s theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A somewhat overlooked installation on the second floor provides a fitting conclusion to the Geology Hall, echoing the opening&amp;rsquo;s depiction of Earth&amp;rsquo;s evolution. Beneath us lies the profound history of Earth and life. On a geological timescale, what mark will our modern civilization leave? What &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; it leave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="behring-hall"&gt;Behring Hall
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hall is named after &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2014-05/19/c_1110757616.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Kenneth Behring&lt;/a&gt;, a businessman and philanthropist who donated numerous wildlife specimens, primarily displayed here. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially the terrestrial animal hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1st-floor-terrestrial-animals-and-environments"&gt;1st Floor: Terrestrial Animals and Environments
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first floor focuses on terrestrial animals from different continents, showcasing representative species from Africa, North America, and Australia. Africa has the largest exhibit, representing the hall&amp;rsquo;s biodiversity centerpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_125318.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This scene is vast; I only captured a portion. The specimens&amp;rsquo; lifelike poses and movements evoke a Serengeti National Park experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps due to my familiarity with nature documentaries, the animal specimens didn&amp;rsquo;t hold my full attention. I took fewer general photos, focusing instead on the text explanations and the animals&amp;rsquo; survival strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_125432.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warthog Specimen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specimens&amp;rsquo; postures have a scientific basis. A warthog raising its tail signals to predators: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m healthy and strong; you likely can&amp;rsquo;t catch me. Consider another target.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_130925.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pertinent question, aiding understanding of natural selection and the predator-prey arms race.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While less diverse in large animals than Africa, North America and Australia are key to this hall&amp;rsquo;s species evolution exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_131718.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are species on different continents so distinct?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammalian evolution has three stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototheria: The most primitive. Like the platypus, they lay eggs and secrete milk through their skin – unlike most mammals, but they&amp;rsquo;re classified as such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metatheria: Marsupials like kangaroos, Tasmanian wolves, and koalas. Born underdeveloped, they require a pouch to complete development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eutheria: Placental mammals like mice, antelopes, and gorillas. A newborn antelope can stand and run soon after birth, fully developed at birth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placental reproduction clearly offers better offspring protection. Combined with other advantages, it led to placental mammals outcompeting the other two groups globally. However, Australia&amp;rsquo;s early isolation by oceans, before placental mammals appeared, allowed marsupials to dominate, while they were replaced elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South America also retains many marsupials. The Bering Strait land bridge provided a narrow passage from Eurasia and Africa to North America. The Isthmus of Panama later reconnected, allowing placental mammals into South America. Their late arrival explains the survival of South American marsupials, which even spread back into North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132448.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cats, highly efficient predators, occupy the top of the food chain in most terrestrial environments. The museum dedicates a significant section to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132252.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cat Family Tree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of a feline tongue-twister: Lions are Pantherinae; cheetahs are Felinae. Cougars are Felinae; jaguars are Pantherinae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132408.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cat Family&amp;rsquo;s First Great Migration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: Cats originated in Southeast Asia. Their unique lifestyle led to remarkable dispersal. Adult cats must leave their families and establish new territories. Their large territories necessitate long migrations, leading to rapid occupation of available land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132413.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cat Family&amp;rsquo;s Second Great Migration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both migrations resulted from falling sea levels, creating new land bridges. Comparing this with the cat family tree, small cats initially spread to all continents (except Australia), followed by large cats from Eurasia and North America expanding into Africa and South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2nd-floor-animal-evolution"&gt;2nd Floor: Animal Evolution
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second floor highlights species evolution, focusing on adaptations to environments. For instance, the entrance introduces convergent evolution, where different species evolve similar features for the same function. Wings are a prime example: birds, bats (mammals), and insects have evolved different wing types, all achieving flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132748.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sideways or forward-facing eyes provide different advantages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132942.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pupil shape, like eye position, relates to vigilance or hunting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132950.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages of different pupil shapes (zoom may be needed).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bird section is a highlight, visually comparing bird beaks to human tools to illustrate diet and feeding. I found the pelican amusing – a living net. However, I question the flamingo&amp;rsquo;s depiction, as they don&amp;rsquo;t primarily eat fish. This might be an inaccuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_133256.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bird Beak Shapes and Functions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next display continues, adding bird feet. You can deduce a bird&amp;rsquo;s diet and habitat from the beak and foot combination. Birds are categorized into seven groups based on feet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wading birds: Shallow-water dwellers, non-swimmers, relying on water for food. Long necks and legs. Small webs between toes aid traction on mudflats. Example: Cranes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waterfowl: Aquatic birds, capable of floating and swimming, some diving. Fully webbed toes act as paddles. Example: Ducks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Landfowl: Ground-dwelling, flight is secondary. Leg strength supports walking. Example: Chickens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Songbirds: Branch dwellers, small, known for singing and nest-building. Thin legs grip branches naturally. Example: Magpies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running birds: Ground-dwelling, large, flightless. Strong legs, enhanced running ability. Example: Ostriches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climbing birds: Inhabit vertical spaces (tree trunks, cliffs). Two toes forward, two backward, for stability. Example: Parrots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birds of prey: Aerial hunters. Sharp, hooked claws grasp prey. Example: Eagles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_133643.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For comic relief: Shoebill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the bird section, examples of animal appearance and behavior adapting to the environment are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mimicry, such an ingenious behavior, deserves more detailed explanation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="exit-corridor"&gt;Exit Corridor
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descending from the second floor, you enter the exit corridor. Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a biography of Mr. Behring and his contributions to science education. One side features a sobering timeline of animal extinctions since the 17th century, culminating in the northern white rhino, which went extinct in the wild in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_131104.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northern White Rhino Extinct in the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public attention often centers on animals, particularly large ones. However, since industrialization, the number of extinct small mammals, reptiles, insects, marine animals, and plants is far greater. The full timeline is truly disheartening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ocean-hall"&gt;Ocean Hall
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent 2.5 hours in the first two halls and started to lose steam by the Ocean Hall, taking almost no photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the Ocean Hall isn&amp;rsquo;t as impressive as the first two. The layout is confusing. You ascend a spiral ramp to the 2nd floor, descend another to the 1st, and then find yourself disoriented, forced to explore radially outwards. The hall&amp;rsquo;s narrative also feels disjointed, lacking a clear storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/VID_20220722_134637.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascending spiral has its moments, captured in this short video: &lt;a class="link" href="https://b23.tv/eIOuBNz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;【浙江省自然博物馆安吉馆-海洋馆入口-哔哩哔哩】&lt;/a&gt;. Ocean-themed photography lines one side of the corridor, the vibrant colors of the marine world creating a strong visual impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd-floor section follows an ecosystem approach, showcasing environments like rocky shores, estuaries, mangroves, kelp forests, and coral reefs. The deep sea should be included, but it&amp;rsquo;s understandably absent due to our limited knowledge. The exhibits are mostly text and image-based, lacking specimens and dioramas due to space constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the descending spiral, several large marine animal specimens (or perhaps models) are suspended overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching the 1st floor, you enter an enclosed area. Small live aquariums are interspersed with display boards, featuring common marine life such as fish and jellyfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branching out from this central area, you&amp;rsquo;ll find exhibits on marine mammals, cephalopods, polar ecosystems, deep-sea exploration, the marine economy, and marine conservation – a somewhat scattered arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_135808.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ocean Sunfish Internal Structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly moved on after this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="natural-art-hall"&gt;Natural Art Hall
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hall was impressive, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t linger, eager to reach the Dinosaur Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Natural Art Hall&amp;rsquo;s theme is simple: no geological or biological expertise needed. Just bring your eyes and appreciate nature&amp;rsquo;s beauty directly – a quick visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1st-floor-the-beauty-of-life"&gt;1st Floor: The Beauty of Life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1st floor celebrates the beauty of life. Leaves, wood grains, butterflies, beetles, shells, feathers, and more are displayed artistically. These natural creations are stunning individually, and their collective display is breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_140604.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beetle display case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beetles in nature are even more vibrant, many with an iridescent sheen. I suspect limitations in specimen preparation and collection prevented showcasing their full splendor. Beetles belong to Coleoptera, the most diverse order of insects, and indeed, of all animals. This species richness results in a stunning variety of appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_140927.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narwhal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Arctic whale&amp;rsquo;s horn remains a mystery. While once thought to break ice for breathing, newer research suggests a more significant role in mating and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_140956.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shells and color wheel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibit highlights nature&amp;rsquo;s difficulty in synthesizing blue pigments. As the color wheel approaches blue-violet, the shells become mostly grayish-white. While blue butterflies, flowers, and feathers are common, these organisms don&amp;rsquo;t actually create blue substances. They employ microscopic structures, a clever optical illusion using other colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_141130.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Golden pheasant neck feathers spread out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2nd-floor-the-beauty-of-non-life"&gt;2nd Floor: The Beauty of Non-Life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd floor showcases the beauty of non-living things – specifically, rocks and minerals. I&amp;rsquo;m no expert, so I&amp;rsquo;ll let the pictures speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tanzanite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanzanite was my personal favorite, likely enhanced by the lighting. The visual effects of transparent substances under light are quantum phenomena at the crystal and atomic levels. The beauty of minerals is, in essence, the beauty of physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aquamarine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dinosaur-hall"&gt;Dinosaur Hall
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short on time, I still decided to explore this hall thoroughly. It was packed with kids, clearly the museum&amp;rsquo;s main attraction for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping inside was breathtaking. A projector mapped images onto a dinosaur model, perfectly synchronized. The projections cycled through the skeleton, internal organs, muscles, and skin – an internal perspective rarely seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_142618.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a hidden gem: easily missed if you&amp;rsquo;re focused on the dinosaur, it&amp;rsquo;s a light strip on the entrance floor, pointing to a wall displaying chordate classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/VID_20220722_142938.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a metaphor: as chordates, we trace the evolutionary path, witnessing its branching, ultimately finding our place – placental mammals. See the short video: &lt;a class="link" href="https://b23.tv/BflQo0E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;Dinosaurs are taxonomically divided into two groups based on hip structure: Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped). Ornithischians have a pelvis resembling modern birds, while saurischians resemble other modern reptiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, birds didn&amp;rsquo;t evolve from ornithischians. Birds&amp;rsquo; true ancestors are theropods, a saurischian subgroup. The pelvic similarity between ornithischians and birds is likely convergent evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I witnessed a funny scene here. A mother, explaining the dinosaur family tree to her child, misread it, saying: &amp;ldquo;Dinosaurs are divided into bird-armed and lizard-armed, got it?&amp;rdquo; She then quizzed her child: &amp;ldquo;What kind of dinosaur is Triceratops? Bird-armed. What about Tyrannosaurus Rex? Lizard-armed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic &amp;ldquo;tiger mom&amp;rdquo; moment: expecting mastery from her child without understanding it herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="triassic-period"&gt;Triassic Period
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dinosaur Hall is chronologically arranged: Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous. Each period features representative species and environments, with numerous fossils and reconstructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_144758.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dinosaurs originated in the late Triassic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the corridor, the Triassic oceans are depicted. Dinosaurs were land-bound – ichthyosaurs and pterosaurs don&amp;rsquo;t qualify – but their contemporaneous existence justifies their inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles returned from land, initially swam like lizards, wriggling their bodies. Later forms swam like fish, using only tail fins – a significant adaptation for deep-sea life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_145044.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixosaurus, with limbs too reduced for walking on land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothosaurs (pachypleurosaurs) also returned to the sea, but differently. They remained in shallow waters, using webbed toes to paddle and hunt small fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_145139.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothosaurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on land, dinosaurs thrived. &lt;em&gt;Herrerasaurus&lt;/em&gt;, though only 3-6 meters long, was a top predator. Its forelimbs were evolving for hunting, with five fingers reduced to three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_145643.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jurassic-period"&gt;Jurassic Period
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the Jurassic, land predators had become even more formidable. As you can see, &lt;em&gt;Yangchuanosaurus&lt;/em&gt; was much more robust, reaching up to 10 meters in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_145715.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yangchuanosaurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the herbivore side, sauropods (part of the saurischian group) were diversifying. These were the giants with long necks and tails, like &lt;em&gt;Diplodocus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Brachiosaurus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mamenchisaurus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the skulls, especially the teeth. Different tooth structures reflect different feeding strategies – much like the division of labor on the African savanna. Nature always finds a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_150545.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 types of skulls and tooth functions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jurassic section features a fascinating &amp;ldquo;Death Trap&amp;rdquo; scene. Note &lt;em&gt;Guanlong&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s appearance – it sports feathers on its forelimbs. &lt;em&gt;Guanlong&lt;/em&gt;, a tyrannosauroid, is related to &lt;em&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt;. As a kid, I always saw dinosaurs depicted as scaly. Later research revealed that some carnivorous dinosaurs likely had feathers. While still debated, it&amp;rsquo;s now the prevailing view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_150803.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_150843.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guanlong profile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cretaceous-period"&gt;Cretaceous Period
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the Cretaceous, feathers were even more widespread. &lt;em&gt;Velociraptor&lt;/em&gt;, a small dinosaur, was closely related to modern birds. Check out the feathers on its forelimbs and tail; it probably had downy feathers all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_151014.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic Cretaceous herbivore is &lt;em&gt;Triceratops&lt;/em&gt;, one of the last dinosaurs. The caption notes something interesting: while most assume the frill and horns were for defense, recent theories suggest they were primarily for courtship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtship again! First the narwhal, now this. A recent study even suggests giraffes&amp;rsquo; long necks evolved for mating, not reaching leaves. Love seems to trump survival – the wild romance of animals. →_→&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_151429.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Triceratops fossil is remarkably complete, preserving most of the key bones. The display, of course, is a model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across from &lt;em&gt;Triceratops&lt;/em&gt; stands its frequent adversary, &lt;em&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt;. Standing beneath it, gazing up at that massive jaw&amp;hellip; the sense of intimidation is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_151536.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t scoff at its tiny arms – judging by the skeleton, it could easily win an arm-wrestling match.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on the first floor of the Dinosaur Hall, look out the windows. The museum has some hidden Easter eggs. One window overlooks a dinosaur sculpture on the lawn – a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dinosaur-lifestyle-and-other-reptiles"&gt;Dinosaur Lifestyle and Other Reptiles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second floor of the Dinosaur Hall is smaller. You&amp;rsquo;re greeted by an animatronic &lt;em&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt;, surrounded by kids and parents snapping photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This floor explores dinosaur behavior. It highlights how challenging it is to study ancient animal behavior from fossils. Consider breathing: we can infer about bird ancestors by studying living birds, but the respiration of ornithischian dinosaurs, which have no living descendants, remains a mystery. Respiratory systems leave few skeletal traces, and soft tissues rarely fossilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_152524.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CT scans of skull interiors might offer clues about breathing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major theme on the second floor is the marine and aerial reptiles of the era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_152200.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two different types of pterosaurs and their periods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 10-meter wingspan – imagine that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_152653.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marine reptiles also have their evolutionary tree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ecology-hall"&gt;Ecology Hall
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hall is massive, but I only had 40 minutes left. I had to speed through, but I grasped the main points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with the Biosphere 2 experiment, a failed attempt at a self-contained ecosystem. Why did it fail? Keep that in mind. The hall underscores ecosystem complexity from multiple perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_153203.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall dedicates considerable space to explaining ecosystem components: producers, consumers, decomposers, their functions, food chains, and how water, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycle through nature. It adopts a wider view, focusing on interspecies relationships and interactions, rather than on individual organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small display exemplifies this. While the previous five halls would&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted a single moment in a pine moth&amp;rsquo;s life, here, its entire life cycle is shown. I&amp;rsquo;ve often seen the larvae and adults, but never connected the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_153648.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the ecological theme, the hall meticulously recreates species&amp;rsquo; habitats. The initial exhibits realistically depict several natural environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_153813.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beetles in their element.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a truly impressive section I couldn&amp;rsquo;t photograph due to time constraints. It consisted of dioramas, akin to those in the Geological Hall, each portraying a different environment and its characteristic species: subtropical desert, North American prairie, alpine tundra, and so on. The animal specimens and settings were incredibly immersive, resembling exquisite crystal balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a unique circular area presents interspecies relationships and interactions, each accompanied by a short nature narrative and a realistic scene. This space truly highlights the museum&amp;rsquo;s creative approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/VID_20220722_154101.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;Check out the short video: &lt;a class="link" href="https://b23.tv/M4LTzxC" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;【浙江省自然博物馆安吉馆-生态馆物种相互作用-哔哩哔哩】&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another interesting point, one most people (myself included) likely haven&amp;rsquo;t considered: Ecosystems vary not just by location, but also by altitude within the same location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_154902.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Everest serves as a prime example. Its 8,000-meter elevation encompasses seven ecosystems, with distinct differences between the windward and leeward sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_154939.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall also explores how various natural factors influence ecosystems. While discussing rainfall, I came across an engaging interactive exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_160033.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram indicates that visitors can drag the screen below to alter the rainfall in the animation, which in turn changes the vegetation. The museum&amp;rsquo;s intention was to allow visitors to modify precipitation and observe the ecosystem&amp;rsquo;s response. Sadly, the device malfunctioned; regardless of the dragging, the animation consistently displayed a rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_160039.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further along, there&amp;rsquo;s more on ecosystem roles and conservation, but I&amp;rsquo;ll skip the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the exit, the initial question is finally answered: Why did Biosphere 2 fail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_160435.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the answer extends beyond those few lines. A small theater screens a film about Biosphere 2. I was eager to sit, watch, and enjoy the yogurt I&amp;rsquo;d packed. However, with closing time nearing, I only managed a brief look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film noted that Biosphere 2 contained an overabundance of decomposers, disrupting the balance with other system components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My overriding feeling during the latter half was a lack of time; I had to rush. Even so, the museum was thrilling overall. I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two minor issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the video content is high-quality, some footage is quite blurry, likely from older sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insufficient lighting. I frequently encountered text panels in dimly lit corners, making them difficult to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some advice for those planning a visit to the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, Anji:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book the afternoon session; it&amp;rsquo;s an hour longer than the morning one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with the four-hour afternoon session, prioritization is key:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have kids interested in animals, concentrate on the Behring Hall, Ocean Hall, and Dinosaur Hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those keen on the broader evolutionary narrative, focus on the Geological Hall, Behring Hall, and Ecology Hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you simply want to appreciate nature&amp;rsquo;s beauty, prioritize the Behring Hall, Natural Art Hall, and Ecology Hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The museum is less than a 30-minute drive from Anji town, so you can grab a bite there beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The museum offers convenient underground parking.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;选择了下午场的参观时间，从12点到4点，时间比上午场长。但对于我这种博物馆爱好者，多少时间都不够啊。事实证明，4个小时看完6个馆，必须有所取舍，每个都细品是不可能的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;按官方推荐的参观顺序，6个馆依次是：地质馆、贝林馆、海洋馆、自然艺术馆、恐龙馆、生态馆。不过我第一次去，看得匆忙，照片拍得少，以文字讲解为主。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="地质馆"&gt;地质馆
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;开场就有点感人，一个球形的屏幕播放着地球46亿年的演化过程。四周小橱窗里配合陈列了各种岩石与陨石，花岗岩变质岩沉积岩，来自火星的陨石，来自月球的陨石，等等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果对地球生命史有些概念的话，立马就能感受到这个开场的妙处：46亿年的沧海桑田，这反复无常的无机环境中竟然诞生了生命。而一旦扎根，波澜壮阔的生命史诗就要在接下来6个馆里展开。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;仔细观看影片，会发现内容惊人地严谨，涵盖了许多地质史上的重要事件。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;雪球地球：波及全球的重大冰河期。冰川扩张反射更多阳光，陆地吸收热量减少，恶性循环，最终导致整个地表完全冰封。照片中是全球冰封后，地壳运动导致的火山活动正在逆转这一过程。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_121129.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;雪球地球&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;盘古大陆：地球史上第二次所有大陆板块聚合在一起，形成了一块超级大陆。盘古大陆中央距离海洋太远，无法被洋流影响到，形成了广阔的戈壁沙漠，这影片也是非常写实的。盘古大陆各部分再次分离，最终形成了今天的各个大洲与大洋。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_120623.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;盘古大陆&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;东非大裂谷：地壳运动正在撕扯非洲板块与阿拉伯板块，形成纵贯整个东非的断裂带。而另一件重要的事情，是人类的祖先即将走出这里，走向世界。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_120802.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;东非大裂谷&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;地质馆的逻辑有一清条晰的主线，就是地址纪年。寒武纪以前的都归为前寒武纪，从寒武纪开始，每一纪都有尺寸和形式完全相同的橱窗，展示当时典型的生命形态，以及所处的环境。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;参观时建议先不理会走廊另一侧的东西，就沿着这一侧橱窗逐一看过去，这是本馆的核心。如果具备一些生命演化与分类学的知识，就能感受到我前面所提的“生命史诗”：原初生命如何在海洋中诞生，生命如何在寒武纪蓬勃爆发，泥盆纪植物如何征服陆地，两栖动物如何上岸，中生代爬行动物如何一骑绝尘，恐龙末日后哺乳动物如何逆袭。一遍看下来，有种一日看尽长安花的畅快。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_122741.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;寒武纪橱窗&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;参观时不要忽视了橱窗旁边的小小地球，每个都不一样，标示着这一纪地表的大陆分布情况。可惜的是，这位置摆得偏低了，即使是儿童视角，看到的也几乎总是海洋，要蹲下才能看到大陆的分布。现场鲜有人与它们互动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_124135.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;白垩纪橱窗&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不得不惊叹于橱窗制作的考究。如果有植物学达人，应该会留意到，从白垩纪开始，橱窗植物开始出现低矮的小黄花，这符合最主流的被子植物白垩纪起源理论。也就是说，白垩纪开始，出现了第一批会开花的植物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_124141.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;白垩纪橱窗小黄花&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看过生命史诗，再回到地质馆入口处浏览走廊另一侧的内容。既然是&lt;strong&gt;浙江省&lt;/strong&gt;自然博物馆，地质部分当然也专注于浙江的历史与贡献。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;浙江由两个地块拼合而成。可以把地图软件切换到地形图，看看浙西丘陵中的裂谷带。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罗迪尼亚大陆：与开场的盘古大陆类似的超级大陆，大块陆地连成片。罗迪尼亚大陆比盘古大陆出现早很多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_121722.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;冰川运动的证据&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;记得开场的雪球地球事件吧？那么大规模的冰川运动，是如何被证明的呢？一个关键是冰碛岩的发现。道理与这个擦痕类似，但更确凿。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;冰碛岩是冰川缓慢移动形成的，巨大的力量把地面无论什么类型的岩石都撬下来，卷到冰河里大力揉捏。很多八竿子打不着的岩石，会在这种作用下被紧紧压实，你中有我我中有你。当它们出土时，地质学家们就知道，哦，这一定是冰川干的，没别的可能了。它们在世界各地都有发现，证明了那一时期冰川遍布全球。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_122130.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;金钉子&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;展板上的介绍有点抽象，关于金钉子，这里展开介绍下。简单说就是：金钉子是划分不同地质年代的标准。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;地球历史46亿年，为了便于研究与交流，我们要像唐宋元明清那样给它划定年代，切成几段。这么长时间地球发生这么多事，只切一次显然不够，光一个清朝还能细分出乾隆嘉庆道光呢。实际上，在地质领域，范围从大到小分了六层。其中最广为人知的是这两层：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;回到金钉子，它到底是什么？核心是特定物种的化石，由于这些物种太有代表性了，与之前的有显著区别，能反映环境的巨大变化，也就能以此为依据划分出两个地质年代。注意，生物只是划分的标记，它划分的是地质史。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;每个展馆都有许多这样的电子互动装置。有兴趣的话，深入了解，可以对展馆主题建立起更立体的认知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2楼一个无人问津的装置，感觉它给地质馆画上最完美的句号，恰恰与开场的地球演变相呼应。我们的脚下，是厚重的地球历史、生命历史。从时间尺度上看，我们引以为豪的现代文明，能在地层中留下什么？我们应该留下什么？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="贝林馆"&gt;贝林馆
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;这个馆的名字比较特殊，是个人名。&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2014-05/19/c_1110757616.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;肯尼斯·贝林&lt;/a&gt;，成功的商人，也是著名慈善家。他向本馆捐赠了大量野生动物标本，其中绝大多数都陈列在贝林馆。这个馆，实际上是陆地动物馆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1楼陆地动物与环境"&gt;1楼：陆地动物与环境
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;贝林馆1楼的主线是几个大洲陆地动物，依次展示了非洲、北美、澳洲的代表性动物。其中非洲篇幅最大，是全场的物种多样性担当。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_125318.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;这是个宏大的场景，只拍了局部。标本的体态动作相当写实，真的像是走在塞伦盖蒂国家公园。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可能是我自然纪录片看得比较多，没太关注动物标本，因此场景照片没怎么拍。我更多是在看些文字介绍，了解动物们的生存故事。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;疣猪标本&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;标本的体态细节是有科学依据的。疣猪遇到危险时会把尾巴高高立起，告诉它的天敌，我很健康强壮，你怕是逮不着，我建议你还是换个目标。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;好问题，让你理解自然生存法则，捕猎与生存的军备竞赛。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;北美与澳洲，在大型动物的多样性上不及非洲，但它们是本场的物种演化史担当。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_131718.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;是什么造就了各个大洲截然不同的物种？&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;哺乳动物的演化有3个阶段：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;原兽类：最原始的哺乳类动物。像鸭嘴兽那样，产卵、皮肤分泌乳汁，和今天多数哺乳动物一点也不像，但哺乳这一项勉强占了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;后兽类：袋鼠袋狼树袋熊，有袋类动物。生出来丁点大，生活无法自理，要钻进育儿袋完成剩余的发育才能独立活动。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;真兽类：老鼠羚羊大猩猩，胎盘类动物。小羚羊出生几分钟，就能挣扎着站起来，一会儿就能跟着妈妈满地跑了，离开母体时已发育完全。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;显然，胎盘类的繁殖方式对幼崽的保护更好，加上一些其他方面的竞争优势，让它们能淘汰前两类哺乳动物，这一趋势在各大洲都成立。但由于地理条件原因，澳洲早早地被大洋孤立起来了，与其他大洲的陆地通道被切断。那时候胎盘类还没有出现，于是有袋类在澳洲称王称霸，而在其他大陆则逐渐被胎盘类替代，退出历史舞台。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其实南美也留存着不少有袋类动物。因为从欧亚非大陆扩散到南美只有一条路，那时白令海峡的陆地还是连着的，有条窄窄的通道可以进入北美。巴拿马地峡断开很长时间后重新连通，胎盘类得以进入南美。由于进入时间较晚，南美仍然有幸存的有袋类动物，甚至还反过来扩散到了北美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132448.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;猫科动物，作为捕猎效率极高的杀戮机器，在各种陆地环境中几乎都占据食物链顶端。本馆也有浓墨重彩的大篇幅介绍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132252.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;猫科动物演化树&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;给你讲个猫科动物绕口令：狮子属于豹亚科，猎豹属于猫亚科；美洲狮属于猫亚科，美洲豹属于豹亚科。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132408.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;猫科动物第1次大迁徙&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;字比较小，可能看不清，我大概复述一下：猫科动物起源于东南亚，特殊生活习性造成了它们惊人的扩散速度。多数猫科动物成年后，必须离开家庭，另觅栖息地建立自己的家族。它们的领地非常广阔，要迁徙到很远才能找到地方定居，因此迅速就把能占的地儿都给占了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132413.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;猫科动物第2次大迁徙&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两次大迁徙都是因为海平面下降，新的陆地通道打开。对比之前的猫科动物演化树可以发现，先是小型猫科动物扩散到了各个大洲（澳洲除外），然后欧亚大陆和北美的大型猫科动物也扩散到了非洲和南美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2楼动物演化"&gt;2楼：动物演化
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;贝林馆2楼的主线是物种演化，关注动物们为了适应环境而产生的种种变化。比如2楼入口处就介绍了趋同演化，完全不同的物种为了适应同一环境，演化出了相同功能的器官。最典型的就是翅膀，鸟类、哺乳类的蝙蝠、昆虫演化出形态各异的翅膀，都获得了飞行的能力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132748.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;眼睛朝两侧还是朝前，为动物提供了不同的能力。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132942.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;瞳孔形状与眼睛位置道理类似，也是专注于警戒或捕猎。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_132950.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;各种瞳孔形状的优势，可能要点开看大图。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;鸟类区是2楼浓墨重彩的展区，形象直观地用人类的工具作类比，表达了不同鸟类的食性和取食方式。看到鹈鹕的时候有点发笑，这小网兜什么东西都要去兜一下。不过火烈鸟主要不是吃鱼吧？这好像是一个Bug。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_133256.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;鸟类的喙（嘴）形状与其功能&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;接下来这面墙是前一块展板的延续，把鸟足也考虑进来了，你可以试着通过鸟喙与鸟足的组合，猜测它吃什么，生活在什么环境。根据鸟足可以把鸟分为7类：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;涉禽：在浅水滩活动，不会游泳，但靠水吃水，长脖子大长腿。趾间有小面积的蹼，增大在滩涂的摩擦力。典型如鹤。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;游禽：在水中活动，能浮在水面游泳，有的还能短暂下潜。趾间蹼张满，作为在水中运动的桨。典型如鸭。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;陆禽：在地面活动，即使会飞，也不作为主要移动方式。双腿力量可支撑身体完成缓慢行走。典型如鸡。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;鸣禽：在树枝上活动，个头较小，善于鸣叫，是筑巢水平最高超的一类。双腿细小，可自然抓握住树枝。典型如喜鹊。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;走禽：在地面活动，不会飞的大型鸟类。双腿强健，奔跑能力相比陆禽有质的飞跃。典型如鸵鸟。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;攀禽：在树干、崖壁等垂直空间活动。两趾向前，两趾向后，牢牢稳定身体。典型如鹦鹉。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;猛禽：在空中活动。脚趾带有锋利倒钩，可以牢牢抓住猎物。典型如鹰。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_133643.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;搞笑担当鲸头鹳&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;鸟类部分结束后，展示了一些动物外观、行为适应环境的例子。&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;拟态这么精彩这么苟的行为，真的不展开讲讲吗？&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="出口走廊"&gt;出口走廊
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;从2楼走下来，进入贝林馆的出口走廊。这里展示了贝林先生的简介和对科普事业的贡献。走廊一侧有条极其震撼的动物灭绝时间线，记载了17世纪以来灭绝的代表性动物，尽头是2018年野外灭绝的北白犀。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_131104.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;北白犀野外灭绝&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公众往往更关注动物，而且是大型动物。实际上，工业化以来，算上灭绝的小型哺乳动物、爬行动物、昆虫、海洋动物、植物，哪止这么点呢？完整版时间线你不忍直视。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="海洋馆"&gt;海洋馆
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;前两个馆用掉了我2个半小时，从海洋馆开始我就划水了，照片几乎没拍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;个人感觉，海洋馆的质量也确实不如前两个。动线有点混乱，先走一段上升螺旋到2楼，再走另一段下降螺旋到1楼，然后就开始不知道往哪个方向走了，因为要以此处为中心向四周沿放射状方向探索。海洋馆逻辑也有点散，缺乏一条清晰的叙事主线。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/VID_20220722_134637.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上升螺旋还是有亮点的，拍了个小视频：&lt;a class="link" href="https://b23.tv/eIOuBNz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;【浙江省自然博物馆安吉馆-海洋馆入口-哔哩哔哩】&lt;/a&gt;。走廊一侧是海洋主题的摄影作品，海洋环境那扑面而来鲜艳色彩，强烈刺激你的神经。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上升螺旋到2楼这一段，是生态系统的逻辑。介绍了水中生命存活的各种截然不同的环境：沿礁海岸、河口、红树林、藻林草场、珊瑚礁。其实深海也应该算，只是我们对它知之甚少。形式以展板图文为主，篇幅所限，缺少直观的标本和场景。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下降螺旋沿途，空中悬挂着少数几个大型海洋动物的标本（也可能是模型，不太会分辨）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;走完下降螺旋来到1楼，进入一个被环绕的空间，小型活体水族箱和展板混合陈列，展示的是鱼类、水母等常见的海洋生物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从这个环向四周探索，还能陆续看到海洋哺乳动物、头足纲、南北极生态、深海探索、海洋经济、海洋保护等主题，比较零散。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_135808.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;翻车鱼内部构造&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后，我就匆匆出馆了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="自然艺术馆"&gt;自然艺术馆
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;这个馆其实很精彩，但是实在没敢多看，因为后面还有个恐龙馆呢。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自然艺术馆的主题很直接，在这里你就不需要什么地球知识、生物知识了。你只要带一双眼睛，直面自然界的美，所以花费时间不会太长。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1楼生命之美"&gt;1楼：生命之美
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1楼主题是生命之美。这里可以看到形形色色的树叶、木纹、蝴蝶、甲虫、贝壳、羽毛等，以艺术化的形式陈列在一起。这些自然造物本身就精美，一旦大量摆在一块儿，气场扑面而来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_140604.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;甲虫橱窗&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其实自然界的甲虫颜色比这还鲜艳，甚至有很多带有镭射光泽。我猜可能受限于标本制作工艺和馆藏资源，没有把甲虫色彩最梦幻的一面展现出来。甲虫属于昆虫纲鞘翅目，所有动物中种类最繁多的一目，物种的丰富带来了最多样的外观。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_140927.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;独角鲸&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;生活在极地的带有长角的鲸类，角的用途至今成谜。曾经人们认为用于破冰，可以在厚厚的冰层下给自己撞出呼吸孔。但较新的研究对此提出质疑，它的长角更可能在求偶繁衍过程中起到更大作用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_140956.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;贝壳与色环&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一个很好的例子，证明自然界合成蓝色的物质是很困难的。色环靠近蓝紫色区域时，此处贝壳多为灰白色。虽然我们在自然界能看到不少蓝色的蝴蝶、花、羽毛，但并不代表这种生物合成了蓝色的物质，而是通过微观物理结构，用其他颜色玩了个巧妙光学伎俩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;红腹锦鸡颈部羽毛展开&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2楼非生命之美"&gt;2楼：非生命之美
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;2楼主题是非生命之美。准确说是形态各异的岩石和矿物，这方面了解不多，直接看图吧。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;坦桑石&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;个人觉得坦桑石是全场最佳，当然也和这灯光有关系。透明物质在光照下呈现的视觉魔术，是晶体和原子尺度的量子现象，矿物的美本质上是物理学之美。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="恐龙馆"&gt;恐龙馆
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;剩下时间不多，但这个馆我决定认真看。现场很多小朋友，非常热闹，这个馆对儿童吸引力最大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;踏进门那一刻，就觉得妙不可言。是一个投影仪把画面投在恐龙模型身体上，位置刚好吻合。画面轮换，展现恐龙的骨骼、内脏、肌肉群、皮肤，别处很少能看到这样的内部透视。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_142618.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;这里分享一个我发现的彩蛋，如果你进门第一眼被刚才的恐龙身体构造吸引，那就很可能错过这个彩蛋。我为此特意退出去，重新进门，你会发现门口地面有一条光带，指向墙壁并分叉为2条，墙上是脊索动物的分类。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一个隐喻。身为脊索动物的我们，重走演化之路，见证脊索动物开枝散叶，最后找到我们人类自己所处的位置——有胎盘类。详见小视频：&lt;a class="link" href="https://b23.tv/BflQo0E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;脊索动物演化树&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="恐龙的分类"&gt;恐龙的分类
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;进门第二幕，是刚才脊索动物演化树的展开，恐龙家族在此亮相。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;恐龙演化树&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在分类学上，恐龙根据其臀部的骨骼被分为两类：鸟臀类与蜥臀类。鸟臀类骨骼结构类似于现存鸟类，蜥臀类骨骼结构类似于现存其他爬行动物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但注意，这并不代表鸟类是由鸟臀类演化而来的。鸟类的真正祖先，反而是蜥臀类的兽脚亚目。鸟臀类与现存鸟类的盆骨结构相似，可能是趋同演化的结果。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_143824.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在这里遇到一个哭笑不得的事情。有个妈妈带着孩子来参观，走到恐龙家族演化树前，开始给孩子讲解。问题是这妈妈可能视力不太好，看岔了，张口就来：“你看，恐龙分为两大类，鸟臂类和蜥臂类，记住了吗？”然后她开始即兴发挥，给孩子现场出题：“现在考考你，三角龙是什么类啊？对，鸟臂类。霸王龙是什么类啊？是蜥臂类。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这就是社会普遍的鸡娃现状。自己都还没整明白呢，就指望孩子什么都懂？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="三叠纪"&gt;三叠纪
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;恐龙馆的叙事主线是按时间顺序来的。三叠纪侏罗纪白垩纪，每一纪的代表物种、自然环境都介绍了个遍，还有大量化石模型与场景复原。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_144758.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;恐龙起源于三叠纪晚期。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;走廊另一侧，介绍了三叠纪海洋里的情况。虽然恐龙仅仅指陆地上的这些家伙，鱼龙翼龙都不算是恐龙，但由于同一时期出现，也一并在恐龙馆里呈现了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;鱼龙是陆地爬行动物回归海洋的结果。早期的鱼龙游泳方式像今天的蜥蜴和鳄鱼，整个身体扭动前进。演化成熟的鱼龙则像鱼类一样，仅靠摆动尾鳍游泳，这是它们走向深海的重大突破。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_145044.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;混鱼龙，四肢已经退化到无法陆地行走了。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;幻龙（鳍龙类）也回归海洋，但选择了不同的生存策略。它们止步于近海，趾间长出蹼，像游禽一样划水运动，捕食浅海鱼类。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_145139.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;幻龙&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;与此同时，陆地上，恐龙正迎来属于自己的时代。埃雷拉龙虽然仅有3-6米，已经是当时的顶级掠食者。前肢开始为捕食而演化，五指退化成了三指。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_145643.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="侏罗纪"&gt;侏罗纪
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;到了侏罗纪，陆生霸主演化得更加凶残，捕食效率提高。从图片对比就能看出，永川龙身体各部分更加强壮，体长最多能达到10米左右。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_145715.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;永川龙&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;食草恐龙这边，蜥臀类里的蜥脚亚目恐龙也朝着几个不同方向演化。这类恐龙主要是身形巨大、长脖子长尾巴的食草恐龙，梁龙、腕龙、马门溪龙等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;注意这3类恐龙头骨，尤其牙齿。不同的牙齿结构反映了它们不同的进食方式，是不是很像非洲大草原上的分工？自然总能找到最具效率的办法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_150545.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3类头骨与牙齿功能&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在侏罗纪展区会看到一个叫“死亡陷阱”的场景，细节很到位。值得注意的是冠龙的造型，前肢已经长出少量羽毛。冠龙是暴龙类，和霸王龙属一类。我小时候人们对恐龙的认识，还是光秃秃的样子。后来的古生物研究逐渐意识到，部分食肉恐龙身上很可能覆盖着羽毛。尽管尚存争议，但这已经成为主流观点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_150803.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;冠龙档案&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="白垩纪"&gt;白垩纪
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;到了白垩纪，羽毛这一特征更加明显。迅猛龙是一种小型恐龙，与现代鸟类有很近的血缘关系。注意它前肢和尾部的羽毛，身上可能也覆盖着细密的绒毛。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_151014.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;白垩纪非常有代表性的食草恐龙是三角龙，这是最晚出现的恐龙之一。图中小字说了个有趣的事情：三角龙颈部的盾牌与巨大犄角，谁看了都会觉得是防御武器。但最近的理论认为它更可能是用于求偶……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好吧又是求偶。先是独角鲸，然后是这货。今年还有一项研究认为长颈鹿的长脖子也是因为求偶演化出来的，并不是为了吃高处的树叶。反正谈恋爱总是比活下去重要，动物们的野性浪漫。 →_→&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_151429.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;这套三角龙化石完整度很高，保留了大部分关键的骨骼。当然，馆里展示的这个是模型。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三角龙的对面，就是经常与它同框的老冤家，霸王龙。站在它脚下，看看这血盆大口，这压迫感不是盖的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_151536.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;不要嘲笑它的小短手，从骨架来看，跟你掰手腕能轻松给你掰折了。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在逛恐龙馆1楼展厅时，有些位置能看到窗户。可以留意一下窗外，馆方在建筑外面也为你留了彩蛋。其中一个窗户望出去可以看到草地上的恐龙雕塑，这个细节真的是很用心了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="恐龙生存与其他爬行动物"&gt;恐龙生存与其他爬行动物
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;上到恐龙馆2楼，空间不大。迎面就是一只会动的霸王龙模型，很多小孩家长围在这拍照。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这层楼主要从行为方面介绍恐龙。看了这里的介绍我才意识到，通过化石来研究古生物的行为有多么困难。就拿呼吸来说，鸟类祖先那一支可以参照现存鸟类来理解，没有后代的鸟臀类恐龙呼吸方式则仍然是个谜。呼吸系统没有太多信息反映在骨骼上，而呼吸器官软组织则无法保存下来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_152524.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;头骨内部结构的CT扫描，或许能反映它呼吸的方式。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2楼的另一大主题是同时期的海空爬行动物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_152200.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;海洋爬行动物也给出了一个演化树。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="生态馆"&gt;生态馆
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;这个馆很大，但最后只剩40分钟参观。走马观花，大致弄明白了它的叙事逻辑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开场先介绍了生物圈二号试验，这是一个最终失败的人造生态系统实验。为什么会失败？带着这个问题去参观。整个馆都在从各角度强调生态系统的复杂性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_153203.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个馆用多展区、大篇幅反复强调了生态系统的组成部分，生产者消费者分解者在其中扮演什么角色，食物链如何构成，水、碳、氮、磷在自然中如何循环。本馆的视角更加宏观，脱离了单一物种，关注物种之间的关系和互动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这块小小展板就是一个例子。按之前5个馆的风格，那一定是用特写镜头，锁定松毛虫一生中某个典型瞬间。而在这里，可以纵览它的一生。松毛虫幼虫和成虫我都见过很多次，但第一次意识到这是同一种动物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_153648.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于主题是生态，这个馆对于物种生存环境的塑造下了大功夫。开头的展区逼真还原了几种野外自然条件。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_153813.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;甲虫沉浸式展现在其生存环境中。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沿途有一段让人印象很深刻，但来不及拍照。那是一系列和地质馆类似的橱窗，每一个展示了不同环境与典型物种。亚热带沙漠、北美草原、高山雪原等等，动物标本与布景代入感很强，像一个个精美的水晶球。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;接下来会遇到一个特殊的圆形空间，列举了物种间的关系与互动行为，每一种都有一则自然小故事，配上逼真的场景。整个空间汇聚了馆方的巧思。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/VID_20220722_154101.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;详见小视频：&lt;a class="link" href="https://b23.tv/M4LTzxC" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;【浙江省自然博物馆安吉馆-生态馆物种相互作用-哔哩哔哩】&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个也比较有意思，应该是大多数人没考虑过的问题，我承认我也没考虑过。生态系统不仅在不同地点有差异，在同一地点的不同海拔也大相径庭。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_154902.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;珠穆朗玛峰是最佳例子。8000米的海拔跨度，涵盖了7种生态系统，迎风面与背风面还不一样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_154939.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本馆还讨论了各种自然因素对生态系统的影响。讲到降雨量时，我注意到一个有趣的互动装置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_160033.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;根据示意图，游客可以拖动下面的屏幕，动画里的降雨量会变化，植被情况也相应改变。按馆方的本意，是让你亲手改变降水，对生态系统施加影响。可惜的是，这个设备没有正常工作，无论拖到哪里，屏幕动画都显示热带雨林。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_160039.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再往后走还有许多其他内容，介绍生态系统的作用与保护，不细说了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;临近出口处，终于来回答开头的问题，生物圈二号为什么失败。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2022-07/IMG_20220722_160435.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;答案当然不止上面这几行字，有一个小放映厅在播放生物圈二号的影片。真想坐下来看看啊，顺便把包里的酸奶喝了。可惜即将闭馆，匆匆瞄了一眼。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;影片提到，生物圈二号的分解者太多，系统中的其他角色无法与之维持平衡。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="结语"&gt;结语
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;后半段全程最大感受就是——时间不够，火急火燎地看完了。但即使这样，全馆看下来也相当令我兴奋。非常精彩的博物馆，强烈推荐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;讲两个不足之处：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;馆里的视频内容质量是挺高，但部分画面糊得令人发指，可能制作年代有点久远。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;功能照明欠缺。经常遇到文字展板在昏暗角落没有光照的情况，阅读困难。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，给打算来浙江省自然博物馆安吉馆的朋友一些提示：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;优先预约下午场，时间比上午场多一个小时。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;即使是下午场4个小时，也要有取舍地参观：
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;带着孩子来认识各种动物，请重点参观贝林馆、海洋馆、恐龙馆。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;关心生命演化等宏观话题，请重点参观地质馆、贝林馆、生态馆。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;纯粹只是想感受自然之美，请重点参观贝林馆、自然艺术馆、生态馆。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;安吉县城到博物馆驾车半小时以内，可以在县城里先找地方吃饭。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;博物馆有地下停车场，条件不错。&lt;/li&gt;

But individuals and society are intertwined in a dance of giving and taking. Imagine society viewing your life. It might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before your 20s, you mostly take, not give. Your parents provide most of this, but society also contributes through public services. From your 20s until retirement, you start giving back more, while still taking, but less. After retirement, giving decreases, eventually returning to mostly taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is merely a proxy. The real exchange between people and society involves labor, services, and even intangible contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal, fair society, your lifetime giving and taking should balance out. During your working years, you naturally give more than you take. This is why we get tired, feel underappreciated, and yearn for early retirement. It&amp;rsquo;s normal – it&amp;rsquo;s how the equation works. It&amp;rsquo;s not a midlife crisis or a societal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s society&amp;rsquo;s perspective; individuals may have other priorities. The personal goal is often to retire ASAP. It&amp;rsquo;s not about idleness, but about reaching your lifetime giving quota sooner, gaining options. So, early retirement hinges on: how do you maximize your giving efficiency?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 35, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely gained expertise. That&amp;rsquo;s the sweet spot to boost your giving efficiency. As a pioneer, you might nudge your industry forward. As a manager, you could elevate your team&amp;rsquo;s output to (or beyond) your own. Entrepreneurs create entirely new industries, with potentially massive efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some might save, buy properties, and open a small store. Their contribution is roughly equivalent to a dozen rentals and supplying local groceries. Value is subjective, but most would agree on the relative impact of these two scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to work anymore!&amp;rdquo; I get it. I often gripe about my job too. But does work always equal giving? Some jobs seem busy but offer little real value, actually hindering progress. Conversely, some people don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; traditionally, yet create immense value, like through investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of investing as passive income is simplistic. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a bank deposit or stocks, that money fuels a business or individual. They use it to grow, boosting their contribution to society. As an outsider, trying to replicate that yourself would likely fail. By simply transferring the funds, you&amp;rsquo;ve increased overall giving and receive a share of the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the experts do their thing. For most, excelling in your field is the best way to boost giving efficiency. If you&amp;rsquo;re averse to the labor, support other professionals, helping them create value, ultimately contributing to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, retirement shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be about becoming a couch potato, secretly freeloading off society. It should be about confidently saying, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve given back significantly, and I&amp;rsquo;ve earned a break.&amp;rdquo; Of course, you might find you don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; that break when it arrives, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>付出的效率</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3598/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 17:36:57 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3598/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;虽然，绝大多数人工作，都是为了有一天不工作，或者至少不做这份工作。但把个人与社会放在天平两端看，付出和索取一定是相互的。如果换个角度，现在你作为社会整体，站到天平另一端看你自己作为个体的一生，大致会是这样：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大约20岁以前，这个人基本没有付出，一直在向你索取。大部分索取是父母的额外付出换来的，但也有许多是直接向你伸手 ，比如一些公共福利领域。从20岁到退休年龄，这个人开始有所付出，越来越多，同时也没有停止向你索取，只是索取得少了。到退休年龄后，付出再次减少，某个时刻开始回到只有索取的状态。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;要注意的是，在这个过程中，不要考虑钱的流转，钱只是一种价值交换的媒介。个人和社会间的付出和索取，是相互提供和接受的各种劳动与服务，当然也包括一些精神层面的产物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;先假定社会是理想的、公正的，忽略社会运转的损耗，人一生的付出总量与索取的总量最终会相等。那么在有付出的阶段，个人的付出必然多于索取。所以这期间你会感觉心累，感觉回报不成比例，感觉想直接穿越到退休年龄。这太正常了，等式就是如此，既不是中年危机，也不是社会问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过规律是社会的规律，天平另一端的个人不见得关心。个人的目标是尽可能让退休提前到来，这不是过了某年12月31日就往家一坐啥事不干，而是更早达成一生至少应该付出的总量，给自己选择权。现在，如何提前退休，这个问题就变成了：在付出期间，如何提高付出的效率。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也许人到35左右，有了些成就，在自己的领域成为专家，这正是付出效率大提升的时间窗口。作为先行者，在某个微微微小领域突破行业天花板，把整个行业往前推动1mm。或者作为管理者，把一个团队的人均付出效率提升到你个人单打独斗的水平，甚至超越。当然还有很多创业者，字面意义的，真正开创新行业，人均付出效率可谓井喷。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，也有人攒下积蓄买几套房子，再用剩下的钱开个小超市。他对社会的付出约等于十几间出租屋，以及一个小区的油盐酱醋。虽然价值这玩意太虚，在许多事情上难以作比较。但这两者的社会价值相较如何，相信绝大多数人会有一致的看法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可我就是不想再工作了啊！这应该是很多人内心的声音。没错，我也经常吐槽我的工作、所处的行业，如今我没有那么热爱它们。话说回来，工作=付出吗？有的工作看似忙碌，实则有效付出极少，与索取不相称，恰恰和目标背道而驰了。另一方面，也有人不工作，或者说不做狭义的以劳动和时间换报酬的工作，却能创造巨大的价值，比如说投资。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;把做投资看做不劳而获的躺赚，是一种幼稚的想法。无论是存银行定期，还是投资基金股票，正常情况下这些钱都会来到某家企业或个体工商户。他们用这些资金发展了自己的业务，增加了对社会的付出。而你作为一个外行，一个彻头彻尾的门外汉，如果代替他们，用这些资金亲自上阵，必定死相难看。资金仅仅是从你手上暂时地转移到他们手上，就提高了向社会付出的总量，其中价值自然有你一份。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;专业的人做专业的事，要提高自己的付出效率，多数人的最佳选择可能还是坚守本职、发扬光大。实在不想付出劳力，也可以带着提供社会价值的目的，支持其他专业人士，帮他们在自己的领域绽放价值。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总之，如果要想象自己退休的那一天，不应该是默默躲在沙发角落吃零食刷剧，为从此向社会伸手索取而窃喜。而是自信地说我付出了很多，你们多数人都望尘莫及，我有权力歇一歇。当然，到时候你也未必真的想歇，那就是另一回事了。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>5-Day Self-Driving Tour in Dunhuang</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3596/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 20:57:03 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3596/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_193003.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 5-Day Self-Driving Tour in Dunhuang" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_192914.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring had just arrived in Dunhuang in early April, a couple of months before peak season. Despite the Qingming Festival holiday, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t crowded. Some sights, like desert plants or the Populus euphratica forest, weren&amp;rsquo;t yet in bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1-departure-and-dunhuang-museum"&gt;Day 1: Departure and Dunhuang Museum
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We flew from Hangzhou, connecting in Lanzhou before heading to Dunhuang. The landscape changed dramatically as we approached – a stark contrast to the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dense, snow-capped mountains appeared below the clouds – the Qilian Mountains. Lower down, melted snow revealed dark rock. The terrain flattened into a dark brown Gobi desert, the boundary between the two strikingly clear. Further on, wind and temperature shaped the land into vast yellow sands. Finally, Dunhuang, a desert city, emerged through the clouds. The whole scene felt like an amazing 4D movie or game cutscene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/9875ha9asf.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d hoped to avoid sandstorms, but the airport wind was fierce. The kind that makes you chase your hat, only to get a mouthful of sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617450274766.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One gust, a mouthful of sand, and you&amp;rsquo;re ready for adventure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617450383379.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we&amp;rsquo;d rented a car. We picked it up and went straight to the hotel. After dropping our bags, we visited the Dunhuang Museum. (Museum = geography and history lesson. Skip ahead for pictures if you prefer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="geography"&gt;Geography
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang, a county-level city under Jiuquan, is Gansu&amp;rsquo;s westernmost city. It&amp;rsquo;s closer to Hami in Xinjiang than Jiuquan, acting as a key passage to Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang is inseparable from the Hexi Corridor. It forms a line with Jiuquan, Zhangye, Jinchang, and Wuwei to its east, connected by a single highway. Gansu&amp;rsquo;s map looks like a bone: the larger southeastern part is Gannan (centered on Lanzhou), while the middle and northwest are roughly the Hexi Corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Inkedmap1_LI.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hexi Corridor&amp;rsquo;s geography is unique – a narrow passage with obstacles on either side. The Qilian Mountains lie to the south, with the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau beyond. The desert of western Inner Mongolia is to the northeast. Mountains from the Tianshan range are to the north. The corridor connects to Gannan and central China in the southeast, and to Xinjiang (the ancient Western Regions) in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/map2.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hexi Corridor is the Silk Road&amp;rsquo;s throat; Dunhuang is its gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="history"&gt;History
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Chinese dynastic conflicts were within the Great Wall. It separated northern nomads, while the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau isolated plateau peoples and Central Asian civilizations. The Shu region blocked South Asian forces. Imagine ancient Han Chinese territory as a water bag with one opening: facing northwest, towards Dunhuang. This location gave Dunhuang an extraordinary historical role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/O1CN01DgJAiN2IZRusqDULh_5719300.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civilization thrives on exchange, not just resources. Contact with the Western Regions began in the Western Han Dynasty. Zhang Qian&amp;rsquo;s mission, despite two captures by the Xiongnu, established relations and connected the Silk Road. The Han Dynasty controlled the Hexi Corridor, with Dunhuang at the forefront of cultural exchange. At its peak, the Protectorate of the Western Regions directly administered the area. The Han Great Wall and Yumenguan&amp;rsquo;s beacon towers witnessed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/The_Death_of_Cleopatra_arthur.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silk Road trade wasn&amp;rsquo;t just China and the Western Regions. Cleopatra VII loved silk, as records and artworks show. Eastern goods spread throughout the civilized world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Screenshot_20210414-000253.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Wang Mang&amp;rsquo;s reforms, the Western Regions rejected his regime, cutting ties with the East. The short-lived Xin Dynasty fell, and the Eastern Han regained control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Screenshot_20210414-000409.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Eastern Han, history focuses on the Three Kingdoms, overlooking the Wei Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s control of the Hexi Corridor and the open Silk Road. It remained generally open through the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties, despite harassment from the Xiongnu, Xianbei, Rouran, and Turks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sui and Tang Dynasties were the Silk Road&amp;rsquo;s golden age. Exchanges peaked. Jingjiao (Nestorianism), seen in &amp;ldquo;The Longest Day in Chang&amp;rsquo;an,&amp;rdquo; was introduced to China. The Tibetan Empire, a unified dynasty, arose. They invaded the Hexi Corridor and Western Regions, cutting off the Silk Road. Tang-Tibetan wars lasted nearly 200 years, with the corridor repeatedly lost and regained. Princess Wencheng&amp;rsquo;s marriage was to appease the defeated Songtsen Gampo. The Tibetan Empire, at its strongest, even captured Chang&amp;rsquo;an and attacked the southwest, allied with the Nanzhao Kingdom. It eventually collapsed from internal divisions. Zhang Yichao, from Shazhou (Dunhuang), led an uprising, captured the Hexi Corridor, and surrendered to the Tang, reconnecting the Silk Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Screenshot_20210414-000154.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, the Song Dynasty was too preoccupied with the Liao, Jin, and Western Xia to regain control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yuan Dynasty was brief but unified central China, the Western Regions, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for the first time, solving the Han dynasties&amp;rsquo; foreign affairs issues. Unity is key to stability. Even after Genghis Khan, with the Mongol Empire split, civilian exchanges continued. This vast empire was a highway for East-West exchange. Silk Road exchanges continued for over a century under the Yuan. Marco Polo witnessed China&amp;rsquo;s prosperity during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20180425-092226_U5965_M405199_1822.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ming and Qing Dynasties were relatively closed, and with rising maritime trade, the overland Silk Road declined. The Qing rebuilt Shazhou City, upgrading Dunhuang, but had little interest in opening it for trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mogao-caves-and-buddhism"&gt;Mogao Caves and Buddhism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang&amp;rsquo;s geography and history are just the backdrop. The Mogao Caves and Buddhist culture are its soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/414-c3d3-hzfekep7421541.jpeg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhism originated in India in the 6th century BC, spreading to China during the Western Han Dynasty. Ashoka made it the state religion of the Mauryan Dynasty, promoting it widely. Many Chinese sites still have Ashoka Temple and Pagoda. Most Eastern civilizations, including the Han, Western Regions, and plateau peoples, accepted Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, India, Buddhism&amp;rsquo;s birthplace, lost its status. Under colonial rule, it gave way to Persian and Arab religions. Its future shifted east, to Dunhuang. Dunhuang&amp;rsquo;s rulers represented Buddhist civilization, regardless of wars and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical changes might have destroyed the city, but for the Mogao Caves, it was a crucible, forging today&amp;rsquo;s treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the Mogao Caves later (Day 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="museum"&gt;Museum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some museum photos. There are many high-definition replicas of Mogao Cave art, for close observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_171207.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model of Mogao Cave 45 (High Tang period). The highlight: 7 statues with excellent expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_171404.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisattva statue, the &amp;ldquo;Beautiful Bodhisattva,&amp;rdquo; depicts the ideal High Tang female image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_165215.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Dynasty documents. The beauty of this writing is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_174523.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A delicate Buddhist painting: the Nine-Tiered Pagoda of the Three Realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed photos of other interesting items. Chain mail, unearthed in Dunhuang, was one. Originating in Europe, it appeared in Dunhuang during the Han and Tang, showing surprisingly fast technology transfer. It was precious equipment, worn only by those of rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_174255.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the hall, we saw a cute modern pixel painting, imitating the Mogao Caves&amp;rsquo; Nine-Colored Deer murals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2-yumen-pass-and-yangguan-pass"&gt;Day 2: Yumen Pass and Yangguan Pass
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We took the western route on day two. The original plan: West Thousand Buddha Caves first (a prelude to Mogao, with more detailed explanations), then Yangguan Pass and Yumen Pass. Finally, Yadan Ghost City for sunset among the wind-eroded rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Yadan Ghost City had closed last year, reopening to be announced – probably for periodic maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/414-2021-04-14%2020_16_24.png"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we adjusted: Yumen Pass first, working our way back, hitting as many spots as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-solar-power-tower"&gt;The Solar Power Tower
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near Dunhuang, we found a solar power station. I&amp;rsquo;d noticed neat squares in this area on the map, thinking it was a new tech district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_105936.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We detoured to the entrance and found it was a CGN photovoltaic project. For a remote desert city like Dunhuang, clean energy is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_111301.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_111314.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the plant, a tall tower emitted a dazzling white light, with beams converging at the top, like Red Alert&amp;rsquo;s Prism Tower. It&amp;rsquo;s a solar thermal station, with thousands of mirrors forming a huge concave mirror. It boils water to drive a steam turbine. Energy efficiency is about 15%, lower than photovoltaics, but it generates AC, easier to connect to the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bright tower kept us company throughout the day, emphasizing the Gobi Desert&amp;rsquo;s flatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yumen-pass"&gt;Yumen Pass
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After nearly 2 hours, we were surrounded by barren landscape. Some sections had desert vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Img-7329-1.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three roads lead into the Yumen Pass scenic area, each to different ruins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right road leads to Dafangpan City and a beacon tower, 12 kilometers away, requiring a shuttle bus (fixed times, so you wait). The bus only stops for 30 minutes, not enough for photos and enjoying the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_135649.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beacon tower on the other side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_135909.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;Dafangpan City details, some with a Yadan feel. The small holes might be ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_141044.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small lake on the northeast side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/414-IMG_20210404_132524.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the start, the left road leads to the Han Dynasty Great Wall ruins, 5 kilometers away, also requiring a bus (15-minute visit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_144048.jpg"
loading="lazy"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruins are shorter than expected, under 3 meters at the highest. The Han Great Wall is 136 kilometers long, from Guazhou to Dunhuang, blocking the Hexi Corridor&amp;rsquo;s entrance. This 300-meter section is the best-preserved in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_144149.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thousand years ago, soldiers used reeds and gravel to build it in layers. Different weathering rates create horizontal stripes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_145105.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One end connects to a beacon tower, always built on high ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Wall wasn&amp;rsquo;t built all at once under Qin Shi Huang, but extended over dynasties. The Han Great Wall was built when Emperor Wu conquered the Western Regions. It included facilities for beacon fire transmission, troop garrisoning, transportation, and farming – a complete defense system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_163338.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beacon fire system appeared as early as the Western Zhou Dynasty (&amp;ldquo;playing with the feudal lords with beacon fires&amp;rdquo;). The Han system was complex, with different signals for different situations, materials, and times of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_163346.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrified firewood, seen in the museum. Soldiers collected reeds and &lt;em&gt;Salix matsudana&lt;/em&gt; branches (unlike weeping willows, these grow upwards). They were plastered with mud for stability. The layered structure is visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_151230.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning from the Han Great Wall, one road leads to Xiaofangpan City (Yumen Pass), a small castle and the scenic area&amp;rsquo;s core, just a few minutes&amp;rsquo; walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_151612.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interior isn&amp;rsquo;t large, but you can stand on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_151731.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;A close-up of the outer wall, made of reeds and sand.&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North of Xiaofangpan City, a modern observation deck lets you experience looking north. It&amp;rsquo;s flat between the tower and mountains, making it easy to spot enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yangguan-pass"&gt;Yangguan Pass
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_172014.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yangguan Pass has few ruins, mostly reconstructions. Siege weapon models are displayed in front of the antique-style pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Wei&amp;rsquo;s line &amp;ldquo;West of Yangguan, there are no old friends&amp;rdquo; is literally true. Yangguan Pass was a border crossing, requiring a pass (equivalent to a passport). &amp;ldquo;Guanzhao&amp;rdquo; (关照) originally meant a pass, but soldiers would protect those with passes, evolving into its current verb meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_181646.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this pass, a beacon tower is the only remaining relic. It&amp;rsquo;s farther than it looks – you&amp;rsquo;ll need transport (battery cars, donkey carts, horses, camels – different prices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617638373728.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend riding a camel. The four of us swayed, the setting sun on our faces. The camel bells were the most beautiful part. The Mingsha Mountain camels (visited later) lacked bells. It was near closing, and the wind and bells made the experience vivid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_8135.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camel team arrived at the beacon tower. Looking back against the light, the scene was desolate and lonely – awe-inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t rush back; the real highlight is ahead. Walk higher, and the scenery behind the mountain will take your breath away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617638502855.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, the same desolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pay extra to have the camels take you along the Yangguan Road, to a valley and sandy area. The guide claimed it&amp;rsquo;s a well-preserved ancient road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s questionable, as the ancient Yangguan Road led &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the pass. But the stele of the ruins is at the beacon tower, so it might be true. The experience is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_193003.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;A Gobi traveler in the afterglow, looking like someone heading towards the vast Western Regions. An amazing end to a day on the western route!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3-mogao-caves"&gt;Day 3: Mogao Caves
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mogao Caves are very close to the airport, even closer than downtown Dunhuang. The site is split into two parts. First, you visit the Digital Exhibition Center, where you watch two short digital films, about 10-20 minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first film is a regular movie with actors, providing background on Dunhuang&amp;rsquo;s history and the Mogao Caves. The second is a 360-degree dome movie, which uses digital models to showcase some of the best caves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual caves are about 12 kilometers from the Digital Center. A buffer zone separates the two, and you must take the park&amp;rsquo;s shuttle bus—private cars aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping off the bus, the sheer scale of the Mogao Caves is immediately apparent. Over 700 caves exist, with almost 500 containing statues and murals. However, only around 60 are open to the public. Some caves, like those in the photo, were monks&amp;rsquo; living quarters and lack murals. Mogao stretches for 1.7 kilometers, and this is only a small part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mogao Caves are a World Heritage Site, a national treasure, but what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; they? Historically, they served as a temple complex for monks and a place of worship for believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, a monk named Le Zun arrived at Sanwei Mountain. He witnessed a golden light, &amp;ldquo;like a thousand Buddhas,&amp;rdquo; and began carving caves into the cliff face. This marked the beginning of the Mogao Caves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that point on, it was like a chain reaction – more monks and believers came to carve caves and create statues. Construction continued from the Northern and Southern Dynasties through the late Tang Dynasty. During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, local rulers maintained the site, but new construction largely ceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cave area is a separate zone; once you exit, you can&amp;rsquo;t re-enter. You can&amp;rsquo;t wander freely – your ticket dictates how many caves you can visit. Booking in advance usually gets you an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; ticket, granting access to 8 random caves with a guide. Caves open on a rotating basis for preservation. The guide unlocks each cave and locks it after your visit, minimizing damage to the murals from temperature, humidity, and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography is prohibited, so I&amp;rsquo;ll use official Mogao Caves or online images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mogao-cave-29"&gt;Mogao Cave 29

&lt;p&gt;This is the caisson ceiling of Cave 29. A caisson ceiling is a recessed decorative ceiling in Chinese architecture, adorned with painted patterns. The vibrant greenish-blue, seen extensively in many caves, comes from malachite green, a natural copper-based pigment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Xia and the contemporary Uyghurs left behind many caves in Mogao, each with distinct features. The walls are often covered with neatly arranged, repeating Buddha images, representing a thousand Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mogao-cave-329"&gt;Mogao Cave 329
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in the early Tang Dynasty, with statues renovated in the Qing Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careless Qing Dynasty renovations left these statues somewhat crude, resembling those in a small, local temple. The main draws of this cave are the murals and caisson ceiling. I find the Tang Dynasty murals the most exquisite. Unlike the thousand-Buddha backgrounds of the Western Regions, the Central Plains dynasties&amp;rsquo; murals tell stories. These &amp;ldquo;sutra transformation paintings&amp;rdquo; (jingbianhua) are a pioneering art form, using paintings to depict Buddhist scripture stories, akin to murals in Western European churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20130914205312886.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The north-side mural depicts Shakyamuni&amp;rsquo;s birth. Before becoming a Buddha, Shakyamuni was an Indian prince. His mother, Queen Maya, encountered a Bodhisattva riding an elephant descending on clouds. The elephant touched her belly with its trunk, and she became pregnant, giving birth to Shakyamuni from her armpit. The armpit birth relates to the Indian caste system. Shakyamuni&amp;rsquo;s Kshatriya family, second only to Brahmins, had their caste status associated with the arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20130914205238427.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The south-side mural depicts Shakyamuni&amp;rsquo;s enlightenment. Witnessing birth, old age, sickness, death, and life&amp;rsquo;s impermanence, he sought truth and escape from worldly constraints. He rode a horse, with four heavenly kings holding its hooves, and flew over the city wall, escorted by singing and playing apsaras (flying deities) to the mountains for ascetic practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures&amp;rsquo; dark skin is due to the oxidation of the lead-based red pigment used for skin tones. Other colors fade, but the skin tone changes completely, requiring some imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20130914205358598.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caisson ceiling is a Mogao masterpiece. The central lotus pattern represents Buddhism&amp;rsquo;s Western Pure Land. The layered details are rich yet organized. The outermost layer features flying apsaras playing musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying apsaras are Buddhist deities of song, dance, and flower scattering, capable of flight with just two silk ribbons. They appear in almost every cave, lively and elegant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20130914205437477.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the north wall is a Maitreya sutra transformation painting. Note the technique: figures face forward, while buildings are viewed from above, with a near-large, far-small perspective. This predates Leonardo da Vinci&amp;rsquo;s perspective painting by almost a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mogao-cave-328"&gt;Mogao Cave 328

&lt;p&gt;On the right is Ananda, Shakyamuni&amp;rsquo;s cousin, known as &amp;ldquo;the most learned&amp;rdquo; for his memory and long exposure to the Dharma. His expression and posture are more relaxed than Kasyapa&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The asymmetrical number of supporting Bodhisattva statues is due to the theft of one by American Langdon Warner; it&amp;rsquo;s now in Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Arthur M. Sackler Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mogao-cave-17"&gt;Mogao Cave 17

&lt;p&gt;The door is numbered 16-17, representing two caves. The larger cave was under renovation during our visit. Cave 17 is the small side cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statue of the monk Hong Bian in meditation is a memorial built by his disciples. The mural behind depicts his daily practice, with maids, nuns, a backpack, and a water bottle on the Bodhi tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 11th century, the statue was moved, and this cave was sealed with over 50,000 Buddhist scriptures, paintings, and documents, covering over 700 years of social history from the Jin Dynasty to the early Song Dynasty. These are incredibly valuable relics. Two main theories explain the sealing: the refuge theory suggests monks hid the scriptures to protect them from war; the abandonment theory posits they were discarded documents that, out of respect, couldn&amp;rsquo;t be destroyed, so they were sealed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/4e36044eb739492da00f54e403e05f48.jpeg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1900, a Taoist priest, Wang Yuanlu, was clearing sand. The guide pointed out sand lines on the cave entrance – oblique scratches from accumulated sand rubbing against the wall, the highest almost reaching the door top. Wang Yuanlu noticed a crack in the wall, revealing brick, not rock. He broke through and discovered the 50,000+ relics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reported it to the government, but the Qing Dynasty showed little interest in文物 protection. Foreign explorers arrived and bought batches of scrolls at low prices. Over 40,000 of the 50,000+ relics were lost overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cave has an innovative layout: three groups of Buddha statues (1 Buddha + 2 disciples each). The front is the present Buddha Shakyamuni, the south is the past Buddha Dipankara, and the north is the future Buddha Maitreya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the Three Buddhas divided by time, there are Three Buddhas divided by space. The Eastern Medicine Buddha (Pure Lapis Lazuli World) is for present-day well-being. The central Shakyamuni Buddha (Saha World) is Buddhism&amp;rsquo;s leader. The Western Amitabha Buddha (Land of Ultimate Bliss) guides beings to escape suffering. Some Buddhists believe the Three Buddhas in space are all incarnations of Shakyamuni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/v2-9821859354cf4b183be61987202eaae4_1440w.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sui Dynasty Buddha statues differ greatly from Tang Dynasty ones, lacking realistic proportions and having large, square heads. The past Buddha Dipankara and future Buddha Maitreya have similar images. The common big-bellied Maitreya image is based on a later cloth bag monk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cave has a horseshoe-shaped altar, but the Buddha statue is destroyed. A lion&amp;rsquo;s tail shape at the remaining connection suggests it enshrined Manjushri Bodhisattva, whose mount is a lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the altar is a massive &amp;ldquo;Map of Mount Wutai&amp;rdquo; (Manjushri&amp;rsquo;s dojo), 13 meters long and 3.6 meters high, detailing roads to Mount Wutai, Buddhist pilgrimages, and local life. I saw a high-definition replica in the Mogao Caves Art Museum (these two pictures are from there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another highlight is the donor mural near the entrance. This cave was a merit hall built by secular believers, so the donors are like sponsors&amp;rsquo; logos – prominently displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Tibetan Empire&amp;rsquo;s decline, Zhang Yichao established the Guiyi Army, seized Dunhuang and Guazhou, and submitted to the Tang. The Cao family, the second ruling family of the Guiyi Army, built this cave. The murals depict Cao family women, their peach-shaped hairstyles indicating Uyghur identity. Uyghur is a Turkic language, and its pronunciation is close to that of the modern Uyghur ethnic group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mogao-cave-96"&gt;Mogao Cave 96
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in the early Tang Dynasty and commonly called the Nine-Story Building, this is the largest structure in the Mogao Caves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s magnificent from the outside, fully utilizing the cliff&amp;rsquo;s height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/792023001.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographed by Warner in 1924. The external building had vanished; only the cliffside Buddha statue remained after thousands of years. The current building is a reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/6354734552697130475181942.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 35.5-meter-high statue of Maitreya Buddha is China&amp;rsquo;s largest indoor Buddha. Carved from the cliff, its details were created with plastered mud. It&amp;rsquo;s a stone-core clay statue, unlike the smaller clay-core statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/027124002.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha&amp;rsquo;s left hand, palm up, is the Varada Mudra (fulfilling wishes – compassion). The right hand, palm forward, is the Abhaya Mudra (removing suffering – mercy). Compassion and mercy are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mogao-cave-148"&gt;Mogao Cave 148
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in the High Tang Dynasty, renovated in the late Tang, Western Xia, and Qing Dynasties, this is Mogao&amp;rsquo;s largest reclining Buddha cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delicate, natural clothing folds reflect High Tang Dynasty customs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reclining Buddha statues depict Shakyamuni&amp;rsquo;s death, signifying his escape from reincarnation and suffering. This is the Nirvana Buddha, and the cave&amp;rsquo;s shape echoes this, with a coffin-lid-like top.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Densely packed disciples and believers show sadness. The guide noted one (not pictured) with higher understanding, smiling, happy for the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s Nirvana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three walls feature a huge Nirvana sutra transformation painting, depicting events before and after Shakyamuni&amp;rsquo;s Nirvana: 66 scenes, 500+ characters and animals – a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body was cremated, and the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s relics were distributed for safekeeping and worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="art-museum"&gt;Art Museum
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visiting the caves is rushed, for preservation, minimizing human impact. The explanations are roughly equivalent to this travelogue&amp;rsquo;s content, hard to remember fully. I recalled this information gradually after returning and researching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, visiting the Mogao Caves Art Museum afterward is essential. Here, you can calmly examine details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum displays models of typical caves, representing different architectural forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central pillar caves: usually large, with a truncated pyramidal front roof and a flat back roof. Believers circumambulate the central pillar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hall caves: similar to central pillar caves, but without the pillar; the statue is in a front wall niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central altar caves: large dome, no pillars, an altar instead of a pillar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nirvana caves: rectangular, coffin-shaped, themed around Buddha&amp;rsquo;s Nirvana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The murals depict numerous buildings from different periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And scenes of secular life, like this hunting scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One depicts the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murals are also key for studying makeup. Tang Dynasty women shaved their eyebrows and repainted them, unlike other dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenes of music and dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clothing, hairstyle, and dance posture indicate this is the Hu Xuan dance of the Western Regions, which appeared in Tang Dynasty celebrations, reflecting frequent cultural exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War scenes, too. This group shows Zhang Yichao&amp;rsquo;s army recovering Shazhou and Guazhou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting are Buddhist stories. This is the Nine-Colored Deer, one of Shakyamuni&amp;rsquo;s previous lives. It saved a drowning man, who promised secrecy. The queen dreamed of the deer, and the king offered a reward. The man, tempted, revealed the secret. The deer, surrounded, told the king the truth. Moved, the king forbade harming it. The ungrateful man was covered in sores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_162558.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;Besides murals, there are other relics. This &amp;ldquo;Rules of the Women&amp;rsquo;s Society of Guifang Lane&amp;rdquo; was a Tang Dynasty folk organization with membership rules and signatures. It was entirely female, evidence of Tang Dynasty openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long star chart scroll, very different from modern constellations. I only recognized Vega.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the museum, returning to the bus stop. Looking east, across the valley, is Sanwei Mountain, where Le Zun saw the thousand Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told at Yangguan Pass that the Mogao Caves might close permanently in three to five years for maximum mural protection. Tourists would then only see digital reproductions. Whether true or not, closure will happen eventually. I hope digital visits can better showcase its charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Digital Dunhuang website, mentioned earlier, is a treasure trove with VR images of representative caves:
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.e-dunhuang.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.e-dunhuang.com/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 NHK documentary &amp;ldquo;The Full Beauty of Dunhuang&amp;rdquo; (about 3 hours) is also well-produced:
&lt;a class="link" href="https://v.qq.com/x/page/c052998o5ua.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://v.qq.com/x/page/c052998o5ua.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="encore-dunhuang-performance"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Encore Dunhuang&amp;rdquo; Performance
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That evening, I saw the &amp;ldquo;Encore Dunhuang&amp;rdquo; performance. Many historical, cultural, or folk custom sites have performances; &amp;ldquo;Encore Dunhuang&amp;rdquo; is truly special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_194344.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue is next to the Mogao Caves scenic area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a large-scale recitation performance, communicating with ancient Dunhuang souls through a modern guide&amp;rsquo;s perspective, traversing millennia. Uniquely, for the first hour of the 1.5-hour show, the audience has no seats. They follow the plot, moving through historical scenes, experiencing major Dunhuang events up close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t take pictures; it must be experienced. The most shocking scene, for me, was Wang Yuanlu transporting relics. The Bodhisattva manifested, and numerous flying apsaras broke through the wall, vividly restoring the Bodhisattvas&amp;rsquo; solemnity and the apsaras&amp;rsquo; agility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="stargazing"&gt;Stargazing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the show, I was still itching for something to do. With all the sites closed, I looked for some natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove about 20 minutes out of Dunhuang, taking a small dirt road off the highway. We had no idea where it led; it was pitch black. We cut the headlights; only a faint glow from Dunhuang remained on the horizon. Obviously, 20 minutes wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly enough to escape the light pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the stars were much better than anything in Hangzhou. No Milky Way, but they were the brightest I&amp;rsquo;d seen in over a decade, rivaling the skies from my childhood in Nanchang. Every star in the Big Dipper outshone Jupiter in Hangzhou&amp;rsquo;s night sky. I used the Dipper to locate Polaris, but it was dimmer than the seven, meaning there were some clouds. Conditions weren&amp;rsquo;t perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter – the next day at Mingsha Mountain, we saw an even clearer sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4-mingsha-mountain-and-crescent-spring"&gt;Day 4: Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Spring
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our plan to visit Baima Pagoda, a lesser-known attraction, was thwarted by road construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="leiyin-temple"&gt;Leiyin Temple
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it was the first workday after the Qingming Festival, we headed to Leiyin Temple near Mingsha Mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s a modern temple, not ancient. The spacious grounds and widely spaced buildings, with minimal landscaping, give it a palace-like feel – quite unlike the compact, nature-filled temples of Jiangnan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some halls are built in the Tang Dynasty style, featuring traditional &lt;em&gt;dougong&lt;/em&gt; (bracket sets). Others are in the later Ming and Qing styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/c39c66bceafa485fa0da99ae4f1e5c22.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tang Dynasty dougong. (Image source: internet)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant spot to unwind, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mingsha-mountain-singing-sands-mountain"&gt;Mingsha Mountain (Singing Sands Mountain)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Spring are two separate areas. Mingsha Mountain is where the action is: camel rides, dune buggies, and gliders. We tried them all, and it&amp;rsquo;s worth experiencing the desert from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the rocky Gobi on the West Line, here it&amp;rsquo;s all sand dunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_133144.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Southerner on my first Northwest trip, I was mesmerized. I&amp;rsquo;d never seen anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617767020803.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dune buggies were the best value. A pro driver accompanies you, but you can take the wheel on flatter sections. It&amp;rsquo;s tough to steer on sand; the wheels drift, requiring real effort to keep straight. We probably hit 40 km/h, and many sections were sloped – a real thrill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_140935.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only this activity lets you pay extra to access a special area. Atop the mountain, there&amp;rsquo;s a desert botanical garden, with low-lying plants spread across the valley – a stark contrast to the dunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617766932897.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend&amp;rsquo;s silhouette. The desert&amp;rsquo;s charm is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_142749.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These plants are almost person-high up close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buggy ride includes sand sliding at Jade Maiden Peak, offering panoramic views: Dunhuang city to the north, Gobi mountains to the east, and dunes to the west and south. The peak has steep, almost 60-degree slopes. Sand sliding is surprisingly safe; the friction is high, requiring effort to move even on steep inclines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mingsha Mountain (Singing Sands Mountain) gets its name from two sound phenomena. Strong winds create a rumble, reportedly audible in Dunhuang city. Sliding down the dunes also produces a hum, especially noticeable with multiple people. The exact cause remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_163535.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we took a glider. It&amp;rsquo;s powered, with a rear propeller, taking off from a small airstrip. The flight circles Mingsha Mountain for about two minutes, passing over Crescent Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/tempImageDataFile.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From above, Crescent Spring resembles jade inlaid in the dunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camel riding was next, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t take photos. Hundreds of camels rested at the camp – a unique sight. The ride passes several photo spots before returning, taking over an hour. Having tried the other activities, and ridden camels at Yangguan, it was less thrilling. Still, desert camel riding is a distinct experience. The constant stream of camel trains at Mingsha Mountain creates a Silk Road caravan ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="crescent-spring"&gt;Crescent Spring
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We headed to Crescent Spring, hoping for a sunset view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_192914.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angled sunlight creates sharp light/shadow lines on the dunes, enhancing their three-dimensionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_194251.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We miscalculated. Crescent Spring, fed by an underground river, lies in a depression surrounded by dunes. Reaching the edge, we realized the sun was already blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_200112.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buildings near Crescent Spring felt like a paradise: flowers blooming within the walls, contrasting with the vast desert outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_195210.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking the corridor, I kept expecting a Jiangnan garden landscape outside each window – a surreal feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_195717.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;From the tallest building, you can see fish in the crescent-shaped lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dark, stars emerged. Despite the light pollution, the clear sky offered excellent viewing. My phone captured this; imagine the naked-eye view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bonfire party campsite lies over 10 kilometers behind Crescent Spring, accessible with a camping package. It&amp;rsquo;s reportedly a good stargazing spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5-heading-back"&gt;Day 5: Heading Back
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No activities were planned. We returned the car and flew out at noon, with a 3-hour layover in Lanzhou, arriving back in Hangzhou that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lucked out with the weather, avoiding sandstorms. A heavy sandstorm greeted us on arrival, but it cleared by evening. The weather improved steadily, only to worsen again two days after we left. I forgot to update my weather app and saw Dunhuang&amp;rsquo;s weather turning. The small square in the center is Dunhuang city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/21-04-08-09-28-14_01.gif"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring in Dunhuang is beautiful, but unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week after returning, I still dreamt of the Gobi Desert and the Buddha murals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tips-for-dunhuang"&gt;Tips for Dunhuang
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having planned the entire trip myself, from flights to hotels, here are some practical tips based on my experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="city-life"&gt;City Life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang is a surprisingly clean desert city. You get the natural beauty of the Northwest with the tidiness of a major city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water isn&amp;rsquo;t as scarce as you might expect. A reservoir supplies the city, and a good-sized river runs through the center. Parks along the river even have a Jiangnan feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang is two hours behind Beijing time. Sunset in spring is around 8 PM. While 2 AM feels like midnight and 10 AM feels like 8 AM, attractions and restaurants generally operate on Beijing time, especially in the off-season. Most places close after 9:30 PM Beijing time, leaving only the night market and some late-night BBQ spots. Plan accordingly if you want both sunset views and a proper dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 1200 meters above sea level, altitude sickness isn&amp;rsquo;t a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget outdated online guides claiming poor network coverage on the West Line (Yumenguan, Yangguan) and the need for cash. Mobile payment is standard in this tourist city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="climate"&gt;Climate
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang experiences significant temperature swings, up to 15-20 degrees Celsius between day and night. In early April, it&amp;rsquo;s pleasant, nearing 20 degrees at noon, and hotter in the desert. Nights are around 5 degrees and chilly with wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a spring visit, pack for both spring and winter conditions. Avoid mesh shoes or clothes – you&amp;rsquo;ll be shaking out sand forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desert sun is intense, even in spring. Sun protection is crucial: hats, sunglasses, and scarves are a must. Sunscreen is essential for the ladies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_185103.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even dressed like this, I ended up with a tan resembling a Dunhuang mural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak season is July and August, with scorching daytime temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="food"&gt;Food
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section is time-sensitive (2021). Restaurant brands may change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local specialties include donkey meat with yellow noodles (驴肉黄面) and braised mutton with pancakes (胡羊焖饼). Expect lots of donkey meat, mutton, and noodle dishes. &lt;em&gt;Shacong&lt;/em&gt; (沙葱) is a tasty local vegetable, often served in a cold salad. Apricot peel water (杏皮水) is the local drink, similar to sour plum soup. Xinjiang and Sichuan cuisine are also widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first meal was at the Shazhou Night Market – a tourist trap with mediocre food. We found much better options later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked locals for recommendations, and they pointed us to highly-rated restaurants on Dianping (大众点评, a Chinese review app). Dianping is a more reliable source than the local tourism bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheng Bianbian BBQ (城边边烧烤):&lt;/strong&gt; A popular BBQ joint, open late – expect a queue. The grilled meats and lamb chops are excellent, with a unique, slightly sour flavor (vinegar in BBQ is new to me!). Their fresh fruit yogurt is also worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huoyanyan BBQ (火焱焱烤肉):&lt;/strong&gt; BBQ and Xinjiang cuisine, also open late. We went around 9 PM without waiting. We recall two noodle dishes: Xinjiang beef rice noodles and a soupy noodle dish (name forgotten).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daji Jiang Donkey Meat Yellow Noodle Restaurant (达记酱驴肉黄面馆):&lt;/strong&gt; A traditional, old-fashioned restaurant with waiters who look to be in their 50s. They likely only serve lunch and dinner. The yellow noodles and donkey meat are far superior to those at the Shazhou Night Market. The donkey meat is thickly sliced, and the noodles aren&amp;rsquo;t overly sour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mostly ate at Dicos and KFC otherwise, due to time constraints. Dicos is prevalent in Dunhuang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other noteworthy mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small pastry stall at the Shazhou Night Market food street entrance serves breakfast. The grilled corn cakes are delicious, reminding my friends from Northeast China of their childhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Liu Ajing&amp;rdquo; (刘阿晶) is a ubiquitous local milk tea brand. Their signature 3-yuan large ice cream cone is rich and creamy – I had it three times in five days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="accommodation"&gt;Accommodation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two main lodging options exist: near the Flying Apsaras statue (反弹琵琶雕像) in the bustling city center, close to the Shazhou Night Market; or near Mingsha Mountain, offering convenient sightseeing and scenic views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang is small, with most high-rises being hotels. A south-facing window guarantees a view of Mingsha Mountain, varying only in distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_084910.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the Bohui Wenhua Hotel in the city center, near the commercial district. It&amp;rsquo;s 3 kilometers from Mingsha Mountain, but the views are still great due to the dunes&amp;rsquo; size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was highly satisfied with the hotel. Rooms were clean, tidy, and spacious – land seems inexpensive here. The staff were consistently friendly and helpful. They even called to inform me of Mingsha Mountain&amp;rsquo;s closure due to dusty weather on our first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps due to the off-season, the hotel provided complimentary breakfast for two days, even though our room didn&amp;rsquo;t include it. Breakfast was delivered to our room, with the option to schedule delivery the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_084948__01.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_100624.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light breakfast was a welcome change after days of BBQ, lamb chops, and fried chicken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="transportation"&gt;Transportation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunhuang is compact, no more than 10 kilometers across. In 2021, there were only four bus lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is plentiful in spring. As a seasonal tourist city, public resources are designed for peak season, leaving ample availability in the off-season. Parking is free at all attractions except Mogao Caves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underground parking is rare. Parking fees are very low, capped at 20 yuan per night, with some places charging per entry. Renting a car is highly recommended for freedom and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car rental companies are almost exclusively located at the airport, which is conveniently near the train station, allowing for easy pickup and return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heed speed limits. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to speed in this vast, sparsely populated area. Keep your navigation on. The speed limit from the airport to the city is 70 km/h, deceptively low for the wide, open road. There are also 40 km/h zones near schools. The West Line has frequent speed limit changes, so listen to your navigation. Average speed enforcement is in place near Yumenguan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no gas stations on the West Line (to Yumenguan and Yadan), and the round trip is at least 200 kilometers, so fuel up beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="main-attractions"&gt;Main Attractions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dunhuang Museum:&lt;/strong&gt; Visiting time: 2-3 hours. A 10-minute drive from downtown, with parking available. Free admission, but advance booking and ID card entry are required. The &amp;ldquo;Bowuguan&amp;rdquo; (博物官) WeChat mini-program offers audio guides for some artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yumenguan Pass:&lt;/strong&gt; Visiting time: 2-3 hours. The furthest point on the West Line (excluding Yadan), a 2-hour drive, accessible only by self-driving, chartered car, or a local day trip. Purchase tickets on the &amp;ldquo;You Dunhuang&amp;rdquo; (游敦煌) WeChat official account. Third-party platforms often bundle tickets with unwanted activities. The West Line is desolate; plan your meals. A restaurant is inside the Yumenguan scenic area, but there are no other dining options en route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yangguan Pass:&lt;/strong&gt; Visiting time: 2-3 hours, potentially longer as it&amp;rsquo;s expanding. Also on the West Line, you&amp;rsquo;ll pass it en route to Yumenguan. Buy tickets on the &amp;ldquo;You Dunhuang&amp;rdquo; WeChat official account. Many farmhouses surround Yangguan, but their off-season availability is uncertain. A Dicos and possibly another snack place are inside the scenic area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mogao Caves:&lt;/strong&gt; Visiting time: 3-4 hours. East of Dunhuang, near the airport (about a 20-minute drive). Staff will contact you a few days prior to confirm your digital movie viewing time. The visit begins with two digital movies, followed by a bus ride to the cave area. Movie showtimes are fixed, so punctuality is essential. Restaurants are available inside the Mogao Caves area, with additional farmhouse-style options closer to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encore Dunhuang (又见敦煌):&lt;/strong&gt; Visiting time: 1.5 hours. In the off-season, there&amp;rsquo;s one daily show at 8 PM. The theater is next to Mogao Caves, with its own parking. This performance and Mogao Caves are usually combined. Careful planning is crucial, down to the hour. Calculate your Mogao Caves visit completion time (based on the movie start time), factor in a meal (nearby or in the city), and arrive at the theater before 8 PM. The first hour of Encore Dunhuang is standing-room-only, moving between scenes. Strict security checks prohibit outside food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Spring:&lt;/strong&gt; Visiting time: 3-6 hours (excluding overnight camping). Spend an entire afternoon and stay for sunset. The scenic area is just 3 kilometers from the city. The ticket allows unlimited entries within three days – activate this by scanning your face at a machine near the gate. This makes dining easy, though restaurants are also available inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="list-of-all-attractions"&gt;List of All Attractions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grouped by location for easy planning. Must-see attractions are bolded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East Line: &lt;strong&gt;Mogao Caves&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Encore Dunhuang performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;West Line: Dunhuang Ancient City Film Base, Western Thousand Buddha Caves, Yangguan Pass, &lt;strong&gt;Yumenguan Pass&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Yadan Devil City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South of the City: &lt;strong&gt;Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Spring&lt;/strong&gt;, Leiyin Temple, Dunhuang Grand Ceremony performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guazhou Line: Yulin Caves, Suoyang City&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other in the City: Dunhuang Museum, White Horse Pagoda, Shazhou Ancient City, Silk Road Flower Rain performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Line is a single road, listed from nearest to furthest. You can&amp;rsquo;t cover all five locations in one day; skip 2-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guazhou Line requires a trip to Guazhou County (part of Dunhuang City). The Yulin Caves are reportedly worthwhile, managed by the same unit as Mogao Caves, and feature many exquisite works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other city attractions can fill itinerary gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local small parks and minor attractions are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="expenses"&gt;Expenses
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotels and transportation are very inexpensive in the off-season. Dining costs are normal, and even fruit prices are comparable to Hangzhou. Our primary expenses were airfare and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in charge of planning this entire trip, and everyone I traveled with was really happy with the itinerary I put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there&amp;rsquo;s a simple, repeatable process for planning a trip. Once you string all the key elements together in the right sequence, the itinerary practically writes itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4月初，敦煌刚开春。比旅游高峰提早了两三个月，虽然是清明小长假，游客却不多。当然，这时候有些风景还看不见，比如开出绿叶的沙漠植物，比如胡杨林。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第1天出发与敦煌博物馆"&gt;第1天：出发与敦煌博物馆
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;清晨杭州起飞，经停兰州，再向敦煌进发。靠近目的地，飞机开始下降，可以明显观察到窗外景观的变化，迥异于江南。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;穿过云层，下方露出密集的雪山，这是祁连山脉的边缘。由于海拔不高，雪山有局部积雪融化，露出深色山体。随后山势趋于平缓，融化的雪水汇聚起来，冲刷出大自然特有的分形图案，画面主体变为深棕色戈壁荒原，两种地形的边界清晰可见。再往前，由于远离山脉和水源，温差与强风继续改变着地形，下方出现漫漫黄沙。最后穿过云层，沙漠城市敦煌，赫然出现在眼前。整个过程像是4D电影，或者游戏转场动画，非常神奇。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/9875ha9asf.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;出发之前我就一直关注敦煌气象，指望避开沙尘天气。结果一出机场就被吹懵了，那是能让你满地捡帽子的大风，当你正要喊“啊我的帽子”时，再塞你满嘴沙。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617450274766.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一阵风，一口沙，就你还来闯天涯？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617450383379.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好在我们是租车自驾，机场取车直奔酒店。放好行李，下午先去逛室内的敦煌博物馆。既然是博物馆，下面要开始讲一大段地理历史了，可以选择跳过，直接去后面看照片。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="地理"&gt;地理
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;今天的敦煌，是甘肃省酒泉市下属的一个县级市，甘肃省最西北的城市。虽然属于甘肃，实际上它到新疆哈密的距离比酒泉还近，是通往新疆的咽喉要道。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;提到敦煌不得不说说河西走廊。敦煌以及它东面的酒泉、张掖、金昌、武威连成一线，唯一一条高速公路把它们串起来。看看甘肃行政区图，一根大筒骨。东南边较大的一头是以省会兰州为中心的甘南地区。中段和西北一头大致就是河西走廊的范畴。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Inkedmap1_LI.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;河西走廊有着极其特殊的地理条件。走廊是个什么样的环境？一条狭长通道，两侧是无法越过的障碍。放大到一整个省的尺度，就是河西走廊。南边横着祁连山脉，上去就是青藏高原。东北边是内蒙古西端的大沙漠。北边是天山山脉延伸出来的大片山地。河西走廊的出口，一端在东南面，连接甘南，直通中原，另一端向着新疆，古时便是西域诸国。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/map2.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;河西走廊，是丝绸之路的咽喉。敦煌，是河西走廊的门户。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="历史"&gt;历史
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;中国历朝历代，多数纷争都限于长城以内。在相当长的岁月里，长城隔绝了北方游牧民族，青藏高原隔绝了高原民族和后面的中亚文明，蜀地又隔绝了南亚势力。抛开现代中国地图，想象一下古代汉人王朝的版图，整体像一个沙漠旅人用的皮制水囊，唯一的开口朝着西北，向着敦煌。这独特的地理位置，注定了敦煌不凡的历史命运。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/O1CN01DgJAiN2IZRusqDULh_5719300.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文明的兴盛不在于地大物博、资源丰富，而在于与其他文明的广泛交流。自西汉起，与西域的交流便开始了。张骞出塞，尽管两度被匈奴俘获，都顺利逃脱，建立了与西域的正式来往，丝绸之路连通。彼时，汉朝的控制范围已触及河西走廊，敦煌是文明交流的最前线。鼎盛时期甚至设有西域都护府，实现了对西域诸国直接的行政管辖。玉门关的汉长城与烽燧，见证了这段历史。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/The_Death_of_Cleopatra_arthur.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;丝绸之路的贸易不仅限于中国与西域。同时期的克利奥帕特拉七世，也就是我们熟知的埃及艳后，酷爱丝绸，有史料与艺术作品为证。表明来自遥远东方的特产已经传遍当时整个文明世界。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Screenshot_20210414-000253.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;王莽改制期间，西域诸国不承认王莽的政权，纷纷断绝与东方的联系。短暂的新朝很快过去，东汉又重新恢复了对西域的控制。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Screenshot_20210414-000409.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;东汉灭亡后，史书的关注点大都在三国的博弈。很少人注意到的是，这一时期的魏国，仍然控制着河西走廊，丝绸之路不曾断绝。整个魏晋南北朝，河西走廊总体保持畅通。虽时常受到匈奴以及之后的鲜卑、柔然、突厥侵扰，但总能重新恢复。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;隋唐是陆上丝绸之路的黄金时期，从政府到民间，文明之间的交流达到顶峰。长安十二时辰里出现过的景教，也就是东正教，正是此时传入中原。同一时期，与外界少有往来的高原民族形成了统一王朝，吐蕃。吐蕃从青海地区下高原侵扰河西走廊和西域诸国，一度完全攻陷，切断了丝绸之路的往来。近200年的唐蕃战争来回拉锯，河西走廊失而复得，得而复失。文成公主远嫁，便是唐太宗时期发生的故事，以安抚当时战败的松赞干布。吐蕃势力最强盛时，甚至攻占了长安，还从蜀地下高原，联合南诏国攻击西南地区。最终，吐蕃在内部分裂中崩溃。沙州（即是今天的敦煌）人张议潮起兵，夺取了河西走廊，并归降唐朝，丝绸之路重新连通。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Screenshot_20210414-000154.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;五代十国之乱后，宋朝疲于应对辽、金、西夏，再无力恢复对河西走廊的控制。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;元朝持续时间虽不长，但它首次实现了中原、西域、青藏高原的统一，解决了汉人王朝的西域势力、北方游牧势力、高原势力三大外事难题。统一是安定繁荣的基础，即使在成吉思汗以后，蒙古帝国逐渐分裂为四大汗国，总体来说也还是他们的家务事，民间往来没有断绝。把它们看作一个整体的话，这直达欧洲的辽阔帝国，简直是东西文明交流的高速公路。在元朝的统治下，丝路交流又延续了上百年。马可波罗便是在此时游历中国，见证了当时的繁荣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20180425-092226_U5965_M405199_1822.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明清时期较为封闭，加上海上贸易的兴起，陆上丝绸之路最终走向衰落。有意思的是，清朝重新修建了沙州城，把敦煌整个升级了一遍，却不怎么打算开放通商。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="莫高窟与佛教"&gt;莫高窟与佛教
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;单对于敦煌这一座城市而言，地理的优越和历史的辗转，都只是铺垫。它们碰撞出的莫高窟与佛教文化艺术，才是这里的灵魂。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/414-c3d3-hzfekep7421541.jpeg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;佛教起源与公元前6世纪的印度，自西汉时期传入中国。当时的印度正值强盛的孔雀王朝，阿育王将佛教定为国教，四处宣扬。今天中国境内许多历史遗迹，都还有阿育王寺、阿育王塔。经过了上千年的浸染，东方文明大都接受了佛教，包括汉人王朝、西域诸国、高原民族。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而作为佛教的发源地，古印度却没能保住它的地位。三番五次被殖民统治之下，佛教逐渐让位于波斯人、阿拉伯人的宗教。它的未来，转移到了东方，转移到了敦煌。无论敦煌经历了什么样的战火纷飞、改朝换代，它的历任统治者，背后都代表着佛教文明。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因此，历史的更替对这座城可能是一种摧残，但对于莫高窟，却恰恰是一个大熔炉，锻造出今天的文化瑰宝。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;莫高窟的故事，我们后面再说。旅程安排第3天拜访，暂且不提。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="博物馆"&gt;博物馆
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;来几张博物馆里的照片，有不少莫高窟艺术的高清复制品，可以让你仔细观察细节。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_171207.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;莫高窟45号窟的模型。这个窟建于盛唐时期，亮点是窟内的7尊塑像，神态形体都是上乘之作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_171404.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其中的菩萨像被誉为“美人菩萨”，极尽描绘了盛唐时期理想的女性形象。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_165215.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;汉代的文书，不必对书法有研究，也能感受到这种文字之美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_174523.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一副很精致的佛教画，三界九地塔。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;博物馆里还有些有意思的东西忘了拍照。锁子甲是其中一个，在敦煌出土的。这种盔甲诞生于欧洲，在汉唐时期出现在敦煌，技术的传递总是比想象中迅速。锁子甲在当时是珍贵的装备，只有一定层级的人物才可能穿戴。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_174255.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;即将出展厅时，还遇到一幅可可爱爱的现代像素画，模仿的是莫高窟九色鹿系列的壁画。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第2天玉门关与阳关"&gt;第2天：玉门关与阳关
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;第二天走西线。原本计划从近到远，先去西千佛洞，作为参观莫高窟的一道前菜。据网上攻略，由于西千佛洞游客较少，可参观的洞窟也少，讲解反而比莫高窟更详细。然后逐个参观阳关、玉门关。天黑前抵达最远的雅丹魔鬼城，在奇特的风化岩石中欣赏日落。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;事与愿违，制作攻略的时候发现雅丹魔鬼城去年下半年就关闭了，开放时间另行通知。可能主要是出于对地质遗迹的保护，不定期休整。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/414-2021-04-14%2020_16_24.png"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是调整了一下顺序，先去较远的玉门关，然后倒回来走。沿途景点能玩几个是几个。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="光棱塔"&gt;光棱塔
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;离开敦煌市区不远处，偶遇一个太阳能发电站。之前研究敦煌地图时，就注意到这一带工工整整排列的小方块。起初还以为是敦煌的新区，发展科技产业之类的，心想这路也规划得太工整了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_105936.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拐进小路，开到发电厂门口，发现这是中广核旗下的一个光伏项目。敦煌这样的沙漠城市，地处偏僻缺少矿产，清洁能源绝对是上上策。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_111301.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_111314.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;光伏发电厂背后，还有一座发着耀眼白光的高塔。可以明显看到周围的光束汇聚到塔顶，像红色警戒里的光棱塔。那是一个太阳能热电站，成千上万的镜面围绕高塔，构成一个巨大的凹面镜。它原理其实很简单，就是靠阳光烧开水推动蒸汽轮机发电。这种电站的能量利用效率大约在15%，比光伏低很多。但由于蒸汽轮机产生的是交流电，不像光伏还需要直流逆变器，更容易接入电网。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在接下来一整天的路途中，这座明亮的小白塔都在远远地陪伴着我们。时刻在强调着戈壁的平坦和一览无遗。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="玉门关"&gt;玉门关
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;驱车近2小时，沿途都是一望无际的荒滩。部分路段有沙漠植物，天高云淡。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/Img-7329-1.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;玉门关景区进来有3条路，分别通往3处遗迹。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;右边道是最远的大方盘城和一座烽燧，距离12公里，要乘坐景区内的巴士前往。大巴定点发车，要等。而且大巴在大方盘城停留时间30分钟，实际上并不足以从容地拍照欣赏。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_135649.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大方盘城全貌。这是一座汉代粮仓，储备军粮。整座粮仓向南侧开门。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_135502.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;道路另一侧的烽燧。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大方盘城几张细节，局部甚至有些雅丹的感觉。注意墙上的小孔，可能是粮仓的通风设施。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大方盘城东北面，甚至还有个小湖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;回到出发地，左边道通往汉长城遗址。距离5公里，也需要坐大巴。停留参观时间15分钟。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;汉长城遗址比想象中矮，最高处不过3米。汉长城全长136公里，从瓜州到敦煌，基本把汉代河西走廊的入口给把住了。景区这一段大约300米长，是全国保存最完好的一段。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_144149.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两千年前的将士们，就地取材，用芦苇和沙砾层叠筑成这一段长城。两种材料风化速度不同，因此今天呈现出规律的横向条纹。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_145105.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;城墙一端连接着另一座烽燧。烽燧作为信号传递设施，总是建在制高点上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;长城并不是秦始皇执政期间一口气就全部修完的，而是经过了历朝历代的延长、加固。汉长城修建于汉武帝征服西域时期，它不仅仅是一段城墙，还包含许多功能各异的设施。如传烽、屯兵、交通、屯田等系统，共同构成一个完整的军事防御体系。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_163338.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;烽火制度西周就出现了，烽火戏诸侯记得吧？汉代的烽火制度有一套挺复杂的规则，不是看到敌人就放烟这么简单。面对不同敌情，要放出不同的信号，使用的燃烧材料与用量也不同，还要区分白天和晚上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210403_163346.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是第1天在博物馆看到的积薪，已经完全石化。这是重要的烽火燃料之一，汉代边关将士除了日常守卫、屯田之外，还要收集芦苇、柳条制作烽火材料。其中柳条是指旱柳的枝条，它不像南方的垂柳，枝干是向上长的，敦煌市里随处可见。由于这两种材料容易被大风吹跑，还需要一层层糊上泥来固定，图中阴影处可以明显看到它的分层结构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_151230.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;汉长城回来，就剩下中间一条路了，通往小方盘城。距离很近，步行几分钟就到。小方盘城就是真正的玉门关，一座小型城堡，是整个景区的核心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_151612.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;内部不算很大，也就比一套刚需房大不了多少。不过城墙上方也可以站人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_151731.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近看外墙，也是由芦苇和沙土构成。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_152650.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;小方盘城的北边，有一座现代的瞭望台，可以让你大致体会当年站在城墙上守望北方的感觉。城楼与远方的山脉之间，一马平川，有敌情应该很容易发现。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="阳关"&gt;阳关
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_172014.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阳关就没有多少遗址，更多是现代重建复原的体验项目。小小的仿古关城前，陈列着各式各样的攻城武器模型，有讲解介绍它们各自的作用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;王维那句西出阳关无故人，不仅仅是感慨，客观讲也是事实。古代的阳关也是一个边境口岸，需要通关文牒才能出入，相当于今天的护照。今天的关照一词，原先就是指通关文牒，是个名词。但是有通关文牒在身，关城的将士就会保护和帮助你，逐渐演化出它今天的动词含义。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210404_181646.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;出了这座仿古关城，远远能看见一座烽燧，是这个景区仅存的建筑遗迹。望山跑死马，照片上看着近，实际需要借助交通工具。这里有观光电瓶车、驴车、马、骆驼可选，价格不一。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617638373728.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我强烈推荐骑骆驼。我们一行4人在骆驼背上摇摇晃晃，落山前的太阳斜斜照在脸上。最美妙的是驼铃声，之后去的鸣沙山的骆驼就没有驼铃。临近景区下班，一路上四下无人。风声伴着驼铃，听觉的加入使感受更加立体。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_8135.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;驼队来到烽燧脚下，逆光远望，无比的苍凉与孤寂。震慑内心的画面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;到达烽燧后，别急着打道回府，真正精彩的来了。继续往高处走，山后面的风光会让你屏住呼吸。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617638502855.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;回望来时方向，一样的荒芜。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还可以额外加费用让驼队带你走一走阳关道，翻过山下去的一段山谷沙地。据牵骆驼的小哥说，它是实实在在的遗址，是保存完好的一条古代道路。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可疑的是，古时的阳关道，是指出阳关之后通往西域的道路。而按照这座现代阳关城的布局，我们的游览方向是从城外向城内走，阳关内侧怎么会有阳关道呢？当然，阳关遗址的碑就在烽燧脚下，这倒没准是真的。不过这都不重要，体验和感受最重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;夕阳余晖下的戈壁旅人，真像是背井离乡，向着茫茫西域进发。以这个画面结束一天的西线行程，简直不要太棒有没有！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第3天莫高窟"&gt;第3天：莫高窟
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;莫高窟离机场很近，甚至比市区更近。景区分为两部分，公路边是数字艺术中心，进来要先看两场数字电影，每场10到20分钟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第1场是真人出演的常规电影，介绍敦煌历史背景和莫高窟的前世今生。结束后会有工作人员引导进入另一个影厅，观看第2场360度球幕电影。这一场挺有特色，用数字建模的形式讲解一些精品洞窟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;洞窟实地距离数字艺术中心有十几公里。中间地带是缓冲区，必须乘园区大巴通行，自驾开车进不去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/414-IMG_20210405_123414.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下车后就能直观感受到莫高窟是怎样的一件壮举。大大小小总共700多个洞窟，有塑像和壁画的近500个，达到开放条件的则极少，只有60多个。有些洞窟是僧人生活起居的场所，照片里拍摄的就是这类无壁画洞窟。莫高窟全长1.7公里，这只是很小一段。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;莫高窟世界遗产、民族瑰宝，但它究竟是个啥？在古代它的实际功能，是作为寺庙供僧人修行，供信徒参拜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;南北朝时期，僧人乐僔来到三危山，也就是莫高窟这一带。看见金光，“状有千佛”，便在山下河谷崖壁开凿洞窟。这就是莫高窟的开端。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自那以后，这里就像个贴吧一样，不断有僧人信徒在此开窟造像，越来越热闹。莫高窟的建设从南北朝一直持续到了晚唐。宋元时期，此地的政权对莫高窟略有维护，但建设基本停滞。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;洞窟区是景区内一块独立区域，出来了不能再进。里面并不能任意参观，门票决定了你可以看多少个洞窟。提前预订通常会买A类票，由讲解员带领参观8个随机洞窟。出于保护目的，可参观的洞窟会轮换开放。每个洞窟由讲解员开门，参观完后立即锁门。最大限度减少人体温度、湿气和光照对壁画的破坏。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于禁止拍照，这部分会引用一些莫高窟官方或网络上的图片。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="莫高窟29窟"&gt;莫高窟29窟
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;建于中晚唐，西夏期间重绘了壁画。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这是第29窟的藻井，藻井是中国古建筑的一种天花板装饰，天顶向上凹陷一块，其中画有装饰花纹。许多窟都能见到这种艳丽的青绿色，大面积使用。这是传统颜料中的石绿，即孔雀石，一种天然含铜矿物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;西夏与同时期的回鹘在莫高窟留下了大量洞窟，而且有它们自己鲜明的特色。壁面常常以平铺的方式，整齐排列大量相似或重复的佛像，表现千佛盛景。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="莫高窟329窟"&gt;莫高窟329窟

&lt;p&gt;经过清代不走心的重修，这塑像有点惨不忍睹，和我家旁边的小破庙差别不多。这个窟的主要看点是壁画和藻井。唐代的石窟壁画，个人认为最为精美。不同于西域民族的千佛背景，中原王朝的壁画是有故事的。这种称为经变画，是一种开创性的艺术，用绘画讲述佛经中的故事，和西欧教堂壁画异曲同工。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20130914205312886.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;佛像北侧的壁画，讲的是释迦牟尼的降生。释迦牟尼成佛前是古印度一位王子，他母亲摩耶夫人，某天遇到一位乘骑大象的菩萨，踏着云朵降临。大象用鼻子碰了碰摩耶夫人的肚子，她便怀孕了，从腋下生出了佛祖释迦牟尼。至于为什么是腋下，和印度的种姓制度有关。释迦摩尼出身家庭是刹帝利，仅次于婆罗门，其种姓地位对应到身体部位，就是手臂。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20130914205238427.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;佛像南侧的壁画，讲的是释迦牟尼的醒悟。他出游看见生老病死、世事无常，决心寻求真理，摆脱尘世束缚。一天晚上，他骑着高头大马，四位天王托着马蹄，飞越城墙。周围环绕着飞天，一路歌舞奏乐，护送他前往深山苦修。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你可能注意到壁画中人体皮肤都是黑的。因为皮肤所用的浅红色是一种含铅的混合颜料，这种颜料氧化变色最为明显。而其他主要是变淡，但皮肤连原色都变了，观看时需要一点想象。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/20130914205358598.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;此处的藻井是莫高窟的代表作，不用讲解也能感受到它的精美。藻井中央是莲花图案，代表佛教西方净土。向外层叠的装饰细节丰富，却主次分明。最外层环绕一圈飞天，手持各种乐器奏乐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;飞天即佛教中的歌舞散花之神，仅靠两条丝绸飘带就可以在空中飞舞。几乎每个窟都有飞天形象出现，灵动飘逸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;北壁上有一副弥勒经变画。注意它的画法，人物是正视，建筑则是俯视，有近大远小的透视关系。这距离达芬奇发明透视画法，还有将近一千年。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="莫高窟328窟"&gt;莫高窟328窟
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;建于初唐，没有经过重修，完整保留了初唐时期的风格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;门牌号上写着16-17，这实际上是两个洞窟。我们参观时，大窟正在整修，看不到什么。而第17窟，指的是侧面的这个小窟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;中央是僧人洪辩坐禅的像，这是他弟子在此为他建造的纪念堂。塑像背后的壁画上，左右有侍女和尼姑，菩提树上挂着背包与水壶，表现洪辩日常修行的场景。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十一世纪初，由于未知原因，塑像被搬到楼上其他窟去了。而这个窟里堆满了五万多件佛经、绘画与文书，窟门被密封起来。这些文书涵盖了晋代至宋初700多年社会方方面面，是极其珍贵的文物。被封存的原因主要有两种说法：避难说认为僧人为了躲避战乱保护经书，将它们封存于此；废弃说认为这些文书是敦煌僧人弃置的废品，但出于尊重不能丢弃烧毁，只好封存。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/4e36044eb739492da00f54e403e05f48.jpeg"

&lt;p&gt;1900年，清朝道士王圆箓在此处清理积沙。参观时，讲解员指给我们看窟门边留下的沙线，那是黄沙堆积摩擦在墙壁上留下的倾斜划痕，最高一条已经接近门顶端了。当时，王圆箓注意到墙上有裂缝，缝里的不是岩石，而是砖。他扒开砖墙，发现了这5万多件珍贵的历史文物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他上报给官府，可惜的是，清朝对文物保护并不重视。消息传出后，许多海外探险家赶来，以低廉的价格从他手中购走一批批书卷。5万多件文物中，有4万多流落海外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这个窟出现了一种布局上的创新，正面和两侧共有3组佛像，都是1佛+2弟子的组合。正面的是现世佛释迦牟尼，南侧是过去佛燃灯佛，北侧是未来佛弥勒佛。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除了从时间上划分的三世佛，还有从空间上划分的三世佛。东方药师佛主管净琉璃世界，拜药师佛主要祈求现世的福祉，许多寺庙内都有药师殿。中央释迦牟尼佛主管婆娑世界，是佛教教主。西方阿弥陀佛主管极乐世界，是接引佛，引渡众生脱离现世的苦难。佛教界有说法认为空间上的三世佛都是释迦牟尼一人的化身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/v2-9821859354cf4b183be61987202eaae4_1440w.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;隋代的佛像于唐朝相比很不同，不像后者那样真实还原人体比例，头大而方。过去佛燃灯佛与未来佛弥勒佛也是类似的形象。而今天常见的大肚弥勒佛，是以一位布袋和尚为原型创造的，但那是隋代之后的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;建于五代十国时期。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个窟有个马蹄形的佛坛，可惜佛像已被毁坏。在残留的连接部位发现了狮子尾巴造型，研究人员推断出此处供奉的是文殊菩萨。文殊菩萨坐骑正是狮子。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;佛坛背后有巨幅的《五台山图》，五台山是文殊菩萨的道场。这幅画长13米，高3.6米，细节极其丰富。描绘了从四面八方通往五台山的道路，以及各地的求佛盛况与民间生活。由于参观时间很有限，没来得及仔细观察。不过后面在莫高窟美术馆里看到了高清复制品，这两张图片来自美术馆。&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另一个亮点是窟门这一侧的供养人壁画。由于这个窟不是僧人主导修建，而是世俗信徒建立的功德佛堂。所以这供养人嘛，就和足球赛场边的广告板差不多了，赞助商Logo要大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;吐蕃衰落后，张议潮建立归义军政权，起兵夺取了敦煌与瓜州的控制权，并归附唐朝。这个窟的建设者是归义军政权的第二个掌权家族，曹氏。壁画中便是曹氏家族的女主人们，桃形的发髻表明她们的回鹘身份。回鹘可以粗略理解为今天的维吾尔族前身，这是突厥语，两者发音也很接近。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160602.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;图片摄自美术馆。画面左一是嫁入归义军的回鹘夫人。左二其实是汉族人，但嫁入了回鹘政权，一身回鹘打扮。左三的发髻有所不同，这是嫁过来的于阗(tian)女子。于阗是以今天新疆和田为中心的一个佛教政权。表明归义军政权夹缝中生存，通过联姻维持着微妙的平衡。从身高可以看出，左四才是这个家族真正的女主人，汉人打扮。但出于礼让其他民族，让出了前面3个位置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="莫高窟96窟"&gt;莫高窟96窟
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;建于初唐，俗称九层楼，是莫高窟最大的建筑。&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从外侧看就极其宏伟，这已经把莫高窟崖壁的高度利用到极致了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/792023001.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;华尔纳于1924年拍摄。外部的建筑已经消失，经历上千年，仅存崖壁上的佛像。今天看到的建筑，是根据历史记载重新还原建造的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/6354734552697130475181942.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;塑像是弥勒佛，高35.5米。这是中国室内第一大佛。由于是在崖壁上凿出大致形体，表面糊泥塑造细节。它与之前看到的不同，属于石胎塑像。大多数中小型塑像是泥胎塑像，整个内部都是用泥制成。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/027124002.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;佛左手平摊，掌心向上，这叫做与愿印，满足众生的愿望，是为慈。右手举起，掌心向前，这叫做施无畏印，拔除众生的痛苦，是为悲。慈悲为怀，慈和悲其实是两件事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="莫高窟148窟"&gt;莫高窟148窟
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;建于盛唐，在晚唐、西夏、清代都有重修过。是莫高窟最大的卧佛洞窟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;官方简介：
&lt;a class="link" href="http://tour.dha.ac.cn/content.aspx?id=659662000840" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从图中可以看到，衣服褶皱的处理极其细腻自然，并且也较为世俗化，是盛唐社会风俗的写照。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;卧佛像在许多宗教场所都有，表达的是释迦牟尼去世时的场景。佛的去世与常人不同，不会再进入六道轮回，避免了一切苦难。这种形象通常称为涅槃佛，整个窟室的造型与之呼应，顶部酷似棺盖。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/927983474985729345.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;背后密密麻麻的，是前来送行的弟子与信徒，大多表情悲伤。讲解员指出，其中有一位境界较高（不在图中），理解了佛涅槃的意义，因而面带微笑，为他感到高兴。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;塑像三面墙壁上，是巨大的涅槃经变画，描绘释迦牟尼涅槃前后的历史和神话故事。66个场景，出场500多个人物与动物，恢弘巨制。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_162219.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在美术馆拍到的涅槃经变局部。4个力士抬着遗体，菩萨、僧人、信徒送行。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_162242.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;遗体火化，最终佛舍利被分送至各国保管供奉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="美术馆"&gt;美术馆
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;总体来讲，参观洞窟的过程还是挺仓促的，当然也是出于保护目的，尽量减少人为破坏。但讲解过程大概也就是本篇游记这样的信息量了，况且你也不太可能都记得住。这些信息，我也是回来之后查资料逐渐回忆起来的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，出洞窟后很有必要再去看看莫高窟美术馆。这里可以清晰、从容地观看细节。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;美术馆里展出了几种典型洞窟的模型，代表洞窟不同的建筑形式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_155721.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;禅窟，没有塑像和壁画，是僧人生活起居的场所。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_155731.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中心塔柱窟，通常都比较大。前面是覆斗拱，后面则是平顶。信徒环绕中心柱缓慢行走、参拜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_155738.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;殿堂窟，空间形状与中心塔柱窟接近，但没有柱，塑像在正面壁龛中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_155748.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中心佛坛窟，大穹顶，没有柱，以佛坛代替塔柱。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_155757.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;涅槃窟，长方形棺木状，以佛涅槃为主题的特殊造型窟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160128.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;壁画中也大量反映了不同历史时期的建筑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160410.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以及世俗生活场景，这是一张狩猎图。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160510.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还包括大量山水风景。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160526.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其中有一张很神奇，描绘世界尽头的景象。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160621.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;壁画也是研究各时期妆容的重要参考。唐代女人画眉与其他朝代都不同，不是靠眉笔或其他东西修补，而是把眉毛整个剃掉，再重新画上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160703.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;乐舞的场面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160711.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从衣着、发型与舞姿，可以看出这是西域的胡旋舞，在唐朝的庆典中出现。盛唐时期的文化交流极其普遍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160810.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这几幅是人们对于天界乐舞的想象。乐器在天空盘旋，不需要人演奏，自己鸣响。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_160935.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有战争场面，上面这组是张议潮起兵收复沙州、瓜州时的行军场景。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_161106.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，最有意思的还是佛经故事。这是九色鹿的故事，释迦牟尼的前世之一，它救了一位落水的人，告诉这人要保守秘密。一天，这个国家的王后梦见了九色鹿，国王重金悬赏抓捕。落水者抵不住赏金诱惑，把秘密透露出去。九色鹿被重重围困，只得用人的语言向国王道出实情。国王听后感动不已，下令任何人不得伤害它。而那个忘恩负义的落水者，则浑身长满烂疮。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_162558.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除壁画之外，还有一些其他文物。比如这份《袿坊巷女人社社条》。这是唐朝的一个民间团体，约定了加入条件与守则，上有社员签名。特殊之处在于这是一个纯粹由女性组成的团体，算是唐朝民风开放的实证。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_162812.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有一副星图长卷，和现代的星座划分很不同，看半天只认出个织女星。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_165716.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;出美术馆回到大巴乘坐点。向东望去，河谷对岸便是三危山，当年乐僔看见千佛的地方。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外，前一天听阳关的工作人员说，莫高窟三五年后也许会永久关闭，对壁画做最大限度的保护。届时，游客能看到的只有数字还原作品。不论可信与否，莫高窟的关闭总有一天会发生的。希望将来数字形式的参观能更好展现它的风采。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在之前8个窟的部分出现的数字敦煌网站，是个大宝库，包含一些代表性洞窟的VR影像：
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.e-dunhuang.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.e-dunhuang.com/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外还有个纪录片《美之全貌》，大约3小时。日本NHK摄于2008年，有些年头，今天看依然制作精良：
&lt;a class="link" href="https://v.qq.com/x/page/c052998o5ua.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://v.qq.com/x/page/c052998o5ua.html&lt;/a&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="又见敦煌演出"&gt;又见敦煌演出
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;当晚观看了又见敦煌演出。全国各地的历史文化或民俗风情景点，往往都有演艺活动。又见敦煌绝对可以说是很特别的一个。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_194344.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;又见敦煌演出场馆，就在莫高窟景区隔壁。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;它总体是一出大型朗诵表演，借由现代讲解员的视角，穿越千年与敦煌的古代灵魂沟通。妙处在于，1个半小时的演出，前1小时观众是没座位的。而是跟随剧情不断走动，进入一个又一个历史场景，近距离感受敦煌史上的重大事件。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;照片我没拍，这样的演出需要亲临现场感受。个人感觉最震撼的，是王圆箓带人搬运文物那场戏。菩萨显灵，大量飞天破壁而出，高度还原了莫高窟里菩萨的庄严与飞天的灵动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="星空"&gt;星空
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;看完演出意犹未尽，想着再搞点什么活动。既然景区全都关门了，就去看看自然风光。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从演出场地出来，向远离敦煌市的方向，驱车20多分钟，一拐弯扎进国道旁的一段小土路。也不知道这路通向哪里，周围完全是黑漆漆的旷野。关了车灯，只有远方的敦煌市在天边发着光。看来要完全避开光污染，20分钟车程远远不够。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;即便如此，这也是杭州市区完全见不到的星空。虽然没有银河背景，但星星的亮度是我近十多年所见之最，足够和小时候南昌市的星空媲美。北斗七星每一颗，都比杭州夜空的木星亮。顺着勺子找到北极星，却比这7颗暗。说明天上有云遮挡，观测条件不算理想。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过没关系，后一天在鸣沙山看到了更加清澈的夜空。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第4天鸣沙山月牙泉"&gt;第4天：鸣沙山月牙泉
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;今天计划去看看白马塔，这是敦煌市内的一个小景点，游客不常去。可能正因为如此，遇到拆迁修路，说关就关了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="雷音寺"&gt;雷音寺
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;这天已经是清明后第一个工作日，上午人少，先去鸣沙山景区附近的雷音寺转了转。这是个近现代寺庙，不算什么古迹。好在内部开阔，建筑间距很远，植物较少，反倒有点宫殿的感觉。和江南寺庙紧凑、亲近自然的风格非常不同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;虽然是现代建筑，其中几座主要佛殿形制却是仿唐代建筑，飞檐下是古朴的唐代斗拱。然而有些较新的佛殿，却又是明清的风格。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/c39c66bceafa485fa0da99ae4f1e5c22.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;唐代斗拱。图片来自网络，不是雷音寺。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总之，不赶时间的情况下，散散心也不错。当然，不看也没什么。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="鸣沙山"&gt;鸣沙山
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;鸣沙山月牙泉景区分为2个片区，鸣沙山这边是游乐区，包含大多收费项目。骑骆驼、越野摩托、滑翔机都在这边，我们都试了个遍。从不同角度看沙漠风光，很值得。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;与西线和敦煌郊区的戈壁风光不同，这边看不到岩石，而是一座座巨大的沙山。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_133144.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对我这个第一次来西北的南方人来说，踏进景区看到这样的画面，眼睛是挪不开的，会一直盯着看。没见过，真没见过。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617767020803.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一个就体验了摩托车，个人感觉是此处最值的项目。每辆车有个专业师傅跟着，开到较平坦的地带，可以换你自己开。在沙地骑四轮摩托，方向盘很难把控，车轮容易偏向，需要大力气才能把持住方向。粗略估计快的时候能开到40码，许多路段是倾斜的，有点刺激。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_140935.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而且，只有这个项目可以付费加程到达一片特殊区域。爬上顶端，山背后是一片沙漠植物园，大量低矮的沙漠植物遍布谷底，和之前的风景又完全不同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/mmexport1617766932897.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同行朋友的一张背影。沙漠的魅力，你定能感受到。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_142749.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这沙漠植物走近看也有将近一人高，算不上低矮了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;越野摩托项目还能让你体验滑沙。行车路线会来到人迹罕至的玉女峰，峰顶四望景观各不相同。北边是敦煌市，东边是远远的戈壁群山，西边和南边是起伏的沙丘。峰顶两侧有接近60度的陡坡，看着瘆人，而且就是要从这里滑下去。滑沙其实很安全，沙子摩擦力大，不用手划腿蹬根本移动不了，哪怕在陡坡上。并非想象中一路到底的情况。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之所以叫鸣沙山，因为它有两种发声机制。大风的情况下，它会自己发出隆隆的声响，据说曾经敦煌市内都听见过。滑沙时，沙丘也会呜呜作响，多人同滑声音就很明显了。鸣沙山发声的具体原因仍然是个谜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_163535.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下一个项目是滑翔机。它是那种背后带螺旋桨的有动力滑翔机，要在一个小型机场助跑起飞。在鸣沙山上空盘旋约2分钟，会经过月牙泉上空。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/tempImageDataFile.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从空中看，月牙泉像沙丘中镶的一块玉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再就是骑骆驼，没有拍照。营地里趴着小几百头骆驼，难得见到这样的场面。从营地出发，途径几个拍照打卡点，再折回来，全程1个多小时。体验过前两个项目，加上在阳关也骑过，就没有那么惊喜了。但沙漠里骑骆驼又是另一种感受，鸣沙山游客众多，往返的驼队绵延不绝，每个人都成了别人眼中的风景，真有点丝路商旅的感觉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="月牙泉"&gt;月牙泉
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;接近傍晚，该去月牙泉了，打算去那边看日落。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_192914.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个角度的阳光打在沙丘上，明暗界限分明，比正午时更有立体感。沙丘最美的时候莫过如此。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然而失算的是，忽略了一个事实。月牙泉是一条地下河渗出形成的，因此能在沙漠中长久存在永不干涸。但这也意味着它必然在洼地中，四周是高耸的沙山。我们走到月牙泉边，才发现太阳已经照不到水面上，被沙丘挡住了。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去月牙泉边的建筑群逛了逛，世外桃源一般神奇。墙内开着娇艳的花，墙外则是万里黄沙。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;走在这条长廊里，每经过一个窗，总摆脱不了江南的错觉，总以为窗外会是园林景观。有点恍惚。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是建筑群里的最高楼。俯瞰月牙形的湖，会注意到湖里有不少鱼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同行的另一位朋友，则坐在湖边，拍下了月牙泉由昼入夜的整个过程。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;夜晚的月牙泉与天边微光，这又是另一番景象，无比宁静。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;完全入夜后，明亮的星斗开始显现。今天夜空无云，观测条件极好。即使此地光污染严重，星星的亮度也不输昨晚。这张照片是我用手机拍的，手机摄像头在夜晚能拍出这么亮的光点，肉眼观看可想而知。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;月牙泉背后10多公里远，还有个篝火晚会露营基地。购买了露营项目就会有人带你去那边，徒步是几乎到不了的。那边据说是不错的星空观赏地。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第5天返程"&gt;第5天：返程
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;最后一天没有游玩项目，中午赶赴机场还车登机了。兰州中转，在机场度过了3小时，当晚回到杭州。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们在敦煌的5天，奇迹般避开了风沙。第一天中午下飞机，风沙很大，到傍晚渐停。之后天气越来越好，直到回杭州第二天，我的气象软件忘了切换回杭州，发现敦煌天气又开始兴风作浪了。图中央的小方块就是敦煌市。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/21-04-08-09-28-14_01.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;春季去敦煌，虽然美好，风险也大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;此行的感受就不多讲了，只说一件事：回杭一周，我仍会偶尔在梦中神游戈壁大漠、看见佛像壁画。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="游玩小提示"&gt;游玩小提示
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;整个行程的攻略、机票、门票、酒店都是我规划和搞定的，加上实地游玩的经历，有一些值得注意的点可以分享：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="城市生活"&gt;城市生活
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;作为一座沙漠城市，长期受风沙侵袭，敦煌街道干净得有点不真实。走在敦煌街头，欣赏西北自然风光的同时，也同时能享受到一线城市的市容。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌的水源没有想象中紧张，保证游客的舒适还是没问题的。城市由水库供水，市中心有条不窄的河。河边几处公园，甚至营造出一点江南的氛围。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌与北京有2小时的时差，春季日落时间大约晚上8点。凌晨2点相当于0点，上午10点相当于8点。但从景点和餐饮服务营业时间来看，这里过的又是北京时间，至少淡季是如此。晚上过了北京时间9点半，当地的餐饮、商场基本都关门了，只剩面向游客的夜市，还有一些夜宵烧烤店。如果既想在景点看日落，又想出来好好吃一顿，你得心里有数。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌海拔1200左右，不用担心高原反应。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;网上有攻略说，西线（玉门关、阳关）的网络非常差，要用到现金。实地游玩发现，好得很。2021年了，旅游城市移动支付应该已经是标配。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="气候"&gt;气候
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;敦煌温差很大，一天的最高温最低温可以相差15-20度。4月初的敦煌，气温总体比较舒适，正午近20度，在沙漠中还会更热。夜晚气温5度左右，刮风时会比较凉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;春季去敦煌，建议带上春、冬两身服装。而且长时间暴露在风沙中，运动鞋、衣裤都不要穿带有大网孔的，否则回去能抖出个小沙丘。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;戈壁与沙漠的阳光非常强烈，防晒工作一定要做到位，春季也一样！帽子、墨镜、围脖都不能少，去户外必须要装备上。女生还需要防晒霜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_185103.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;即使武装成我这样，回来仍然黑得跟敦煌壁画小人似的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌的旺季是7、8月份，那时候白天就非常热了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="饮食"&gt;饮食
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;这部分有很强的时效性，这是2021年。再过几年，当地的餐饮品牌大换血也说不定。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌本地出名的美食，有驴肉黄面和胡羊焖饼。其他特色小吃也大多是驴肉制品、羊肉制品、以及面食。还有一种本地特色的素菜，沙葱，凉拌挺好吃。当地的特色饮料是杏皮水，喝起来像酸梅汤。除了本地菜外，敦煌还随处可见新疆菜和川菜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们第一顿饭就去了沙洲夜市。毕竟是专门面向游客的地方，你不能对此处的口味和性价比期待太高。后几天我们在别处吃得都比这好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;某天夜晚市区闲逛，问了当地的生意人，平时都去什么地方吃。他们推荐的几家餐馆都不错，一查基本都是大众点评上排名靠前的。在陌生的地方找美食，大众点评还是比当地旅游局靠谱。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;城边边烧烤：&lt;/strong&gt; 因为是烧烤，会营业到比较晚，生意很好，需要排队。各种烤肉、羊排都很棒。他们的口味和我们这边烧烤不一样，有一点微酸，但很提鲜。反正烧烤里放醋我真是头一回见。它还有个鲜果酸奶令人印象深刻。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;火焱焱烤肉：&lt;/strong&gt; 烧烤+新疆菜，也会营业到比较晚，我们晚上9点多去的，没有排队。他们家印象较深的是两种面食，新疆牛肉米粉，还有一道带汤的什么面片，忘了名字。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;达记酱驴肉黄面馆：&lt;/strong&gt; 一家小店，装修风格老派，服务员平均50岁上下，看着很像当地传统面馆。应该只供应正餐，不做夜宵。这里的黄面和驴肉比沙洲夜市吃到的好很多，驴肉切得挺厚，黄面也没有太重的酸味。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于时间原因，除这几顿，其他基本都吃的是德克士、肯德基了。当地德克士特别多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;正餐外还有两个值得一提：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;沙洲夜市美食街入口处有家面点小档口，供应早餐。烤玉米面饼很香，同行的两个东北朋友说，这是他们小时候的味道。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;当地有个叫“刘阿晶”的奶茶店品牌，随处可见，招牌是3元一个的大甜筒。奶味浓郁，5天内我买了3次。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="住宿"&gt;住宿
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;在敦煌市区住主要有两个选择：要么离反弹琵琶雕像近，这边是市中心，商业繁华，旁边就是沙洲夜市。要么离鸣沙山近，游玩方便，窗外风景优美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌市人口很少，高层楼房几乎都是酒店。只要窗户朝南，都能看见鸣沙山，只是远近的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_084910.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们住在市中心博汇文华酒店，离商业区近。距离鸣沙山有3公里，风景仍然不错，因为沙丘实在高大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这家酒店我感觉很满意。房间干净整洁，也宽敞。看来这边的土地是真便宜。服务人员总是微笑相迎，有求必应。第1天我们在博物馆，酒店接到通知，说因为沙尘天气鸣沙山景区关闭，还特意为此打电话提醒我。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可能由于是淡季，虽然我们订的房间不含早，酒店仍然送了两天的早餐。早餐送到房间，还能提前一天约好送来的时间。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210406_084948__01.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2021-04/IMG_20210405_100624.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;早餐食物比较清淡。连吃了几天的烧烤、羊排、炸鸡，这正是你需要的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="交通"&gt;交通
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;敦煌市很小，直径不超过10公里。2021年，公交车只有4条线路，规模可想而知。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;春季在敦煌停车很方便，车位不紧张。它是个有明显季节性的纯旅游城市，公共资源都是按旺季的需求量来规划的，淡季来绰绰有余。除莫高窟外，所有景点停车都免费。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这边很少有地下停车场。停车费极其便宜，一晚上不超过20，甚至有的地方是按次收费。所以建议租车自驾，轻松自由。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;敦煌市几乎找不到租车公司，都聚集在机场。这反而方便，机场附近就是火车站，直接在交通枢纽借车还车。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自驾要特别注意限速，地广人稀很容易超速，导航要全程开。从机场到敦煌市区路段限速只有70，但那宽阔无人的的样子，怎么看都不像70。中途还有几个点经过学校，限速40。西线也是，限速经常变，注意听导航。靠近玉门关有一段还是区间测速。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;西线（去玉门关和雅丹）一路上都没有加油站，来回至少200公里，提前做准备。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="主要景点"&gt;主要景点
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;敦煌博物馆：&lt;/strong&gt; 游玩时间2-3小时。距离敦煌市中心车程10几分钟，有停车场。门票免费，但需提前预约，刷身份证进入。有个微信小程序“博物官”，包含其中一些馆藏文物的语音讲解，参观过程中或者晚上回酒店可以听听。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;玉门关：&lt;/strong&gt; 游玩时间：2-3小时。西线最远端（不算雅丹的话），驾车2小时，只有自驾、包车、当地一日游团才能到得了。门票建议去“游敦煌”微信公众号上买，这是官方平台。第三方平台上很难买到纯门票，往往是门票加游玩项目的搭售套餐，未必是你需要的。西线比较荒凉，要考虑吃饭问题。玉门关景区内有一家餐馆，除此之外沿途没有任何地方可以用餐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;阳关：&lt;/strong&gt; 游玩时间：2-3小时，未来如果要玩遍的话时间会更长，因为它在扩建新游乐项目。也在西线上，去玉门关会路过。门票同样建议去“游敦煌”微信公众号买，这个公众号上可以买到除几个石窟和演出之外的其他主要景点门票，可见是有单位统一管理的。阳关周边有不少农家乐，就是没见着人，也不知道淡季开不开门。景区内有家德克士，如果没记错的话，好像还有另一家什么小吃。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;莫高窟：&lt;/strong&gt; 游玩时间：3-4小时。在敦煌市东边，机场方向，驾车20分钟左右。游玩前几天，会有工作人员联系你，和你确定看数字电影的时间。因为莫高窟的参观从看两场数字电影开始，电影放完马上被会领去乘坐大巴车，前往洞窟区。电影有固定场次，你得准时到。莫高窟景区内有餐馆，再往机场方向去一点点路，也有些类似于农家乐的地方。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;又见敦煌：&lt;/strong&gt; 游玩时间：1.5小时。淡季每天只有一场，晚上8点开演。剧场就在莫高窟隔壁，有它自己的停车场。通常都会把这个演出和参观莫高窟安排在同一天。但这天的时间需要很仔细规划，精确到小时。根据莫高窟数字电影开场时间，算准参观完出来的时间，在附近或回市区吃个饭，再赶在8点前来剧场看演出。又见敦煌演出的前一小时没有座位，要跟随剧情走动，进入一个个场景。剧场有严格的安检，不能带水和食物进入。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;鸣沙山月牙泉：&lt;/strong&gt; 游玩时间：3-6小时，这是不露营过夜的情况。若不是赶时间，这里基本值得待上一整个下午，并留下来看日落。景区离敦煌市区非常近，3公里。它的门票三天内可无限次进入景区，进去后要在大门旁边的机器上刷个脸才能激活此权利。有了这个无限次进入的福利，吃饭就不是问题了。当然，景区里面也有好几家餐馆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="全部景点清单"&gt;全部景点清单
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;按地理位置分组归类，便于选择和规划。必去景点加粗表示。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;东线：&lt;strong&gt;莫高窟&lt;/strong&gt;、&lt;strong&gt;又见敦煌演出&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;西线：敦煌古城影视基地、西千佛洞、阳关、&lt;strong&gt;玉门关&lt;/strong&gt;、&lt;strong&gt;雅丹魔鬼城&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;城南：&lt;strong&gt;鸣沙山月牙泉&lt;/strong&gt;、雷音寺、敦煌盛典演出&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;瓜州线：榆林窟、锁阳城&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;市区其他：敦煌博物馆、白马塔、沙州故城、丝路花雨演出&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;西线只有一条道，按由近及远的顺序列出。这5个地方没法一天玩完，建议放弃其中2-3个。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;瓜州线比较远，要去敦煌市下辖的瓜州县城。但那边的榆林窟据说很值得一看，与莫高窟同个单位管理，也有不少精品。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;市区其他是一些可以见缝插针填补行程空白的景点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除此之外，本地小公园以及一些太小的景点，就不算进来了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="开支"&gt;开支
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;在淡季，这边酒店和交通都非常便宜。餐饮也是正常水平，甚至水果都不比杭州贵。我们主要花费是在机票和游乐项目上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;之前看到家用微电流美容仪的广告，老婆说想买。这玩意跟我没什么关系，从来没关注过。那天不知道怎么回事，就想看看这玩意怎么个原理，微电流怎么就能美容了。仔细读了商品详情，说微电流有助于刺激皮肤深层组织产生更多胶原蛋白，使皮肤变紧致Q弹，只字不提原理。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好嘛，你不告诉我我自己查。去Google Scholar上搜了下学术论文，用electric current collagen（电流、胶原蛋白）这几个关键词搜的。从标题看，与这个话题明显有关的其实不多。读了其中的几篇，大家的研究成果基本可以总结如下：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在小鼠身上做手术，微电流刺激可以加速生成胶原蛋白，促进手术创口的愈合，修复皮肤的破损部分。这个方法有望用于治疗一些皮肤疾病，可以作为一种非侵入式疗法，一定程度代替现有的化学治疗。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;学术论文就说到此为止了。好，现在想想。广告说的和这是一回事么？微电流加速创口愈合，可没说对你完好无损的皮肤还有用。人体的愈合能力虽然还挺强，不过是有限度的，长好了就不会再额外长。不然无限制增生，我们早就长成一个个大肉球了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;论文里确实提到了“skin problem”这个词，就是这个模棱两可的词，让人可以大做文章。人家的skin problem指的是疾病和创伤，你倒好，衰老都能算了是吧？衰老如果是个问题，那我还觉得排泄麻烦呢？有没有产品可以解决我这个问题？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，事情结果是老婆把这4000多的美容仪退了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里我不是想骂美容仪什么的。只要有人爱买，你卖你的，我也不想管。但是我们应该以一个什么样的态度对待这个商业世界，对待满天飞的广告卖点，这是个值得自省的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我觉得对待广告里的所谓“知识”有3条原则：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对于完全不了解的领域，优先选择不信。说真的广告里没有多少真实可靠的知识，统统不信错杀不了多少。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对于一知半解的领域，有兴趣就了解下，毕竟也是个学习机会。没兴趣就参照第1条。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对于熟悉的领域，有责任指出其中的虚假信息，防止亲朋好友交智商税。不认识的人我就管不着了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回头看看这些商业广告，尤其食品和健康领域。你有没有见过哪家食品广告的卖点是“就是好吃”？不附加点什么功效都不好意思出来见人吧。更有甚者，产品本身的功能就是一个虚假功效，这更多出现在健康领域。如果按照这些满嘴跑火车的所谓“知识”活着，要说很大的害处嘛倒也没有，无非是瘪了钱包，累了心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我认识的一个境界远高于我的人跟我说过：“世界很残酷，你以为生活和平安稳，其实身边都是镰刀，一个不小心就割你一刀。”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Bit of Homework on Suzhou Gardens</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3592/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 10:18:27 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3592/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m visiting Suzhou&amp;rsquo;s gardens during the National Day holiday. My previous visit, as a student, was underwhelming – I knew little about them, and only the Lion Grove Garden&amp;rsquo;s rockery maze stuck with me. To avoid a repeat, I did some prep work. Now, they&amp;rsquo;re far more intriguing, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expecting crowds, I&amp;rsquo;m not aiming for great photos. If I get any, I might expand this into a travelogue. Otherwise, these notes will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main source is the podcast &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="http://xima.tv/x2UAWF?_sonic=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;园林里的中国故事&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (Chinese Gardens&amp;rsquo; Stories), a summary of key facts about several gardens. I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with the host, but I&amp;rsquo;ve verified the information. The host&amp;rsquo;s deep historical and cultural knowledge, and clear connections, make it a worthwhile listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, three garden systems stand out: Chinese classical, European geometric, and Japanese gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese classical gardens have three branches: imperial gardens, Jiangnan&amp;rsquo;s private gardens, and Lingnan gardens. Lingnan gardens, historically on the periphery, lacked the literati influence and wealth, developing a distinct, folk-influenced style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s Four Great Gardens are the Summer Palace, Chengde Mountain Resort, Humble Administrator&amp;rsquo;s Garden, and Lingering Garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator&amp;rsquo;s Garden, and Lingering Garden represent the four major Suzhou gardens, showcasing Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasty styles, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="origins-and-history"&gt;Origins and History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese gardens originated in the Qin and Han dynasties, alongside ancient Chinese architecture, but were initially imperial hunting grounds. Earlier rulers had similar areas, but not true gardens. These took the form of &lt;em&gt;tai&lt;/em&gt; (platforms), &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; (pastures), and &lt;em&gt;zhao&lt;/em&gt; (ponds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor Wu of Han expanded Shanglin Yuan into the largest garden ever. It served as a zoo, botanical garden, farm, mine, and military training ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties marked China&amp;rsquo;s second ideological liberation, after the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Previously, literati talents served solely political ends. The 300-year chaos of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties freed literati, making them an independent class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial gardens stagnated during this time. Meanwhile, literati, disillusioned by the turmoil, embraced reclusion, cultivating unique theories, spiritual worlds, and garden art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taoism rose concurrently, and Buddhism, introduced in the Han Dynasty, peaked. Temple gardens flourished, often in remote locations, opening up scenic areas for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardens peaked in the prosperous Tang Dynasty, displaying a bold, magnificent style. This era represented a zenith in Chinese military, economic, and cultural power. Gardens, poetry, and other cultural outputs reflected this confidence. The largest Tang imperial garden surpassed even the later Forbidden City in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tang Dynasty boasted advanced flower cultivation, and private gardens began to prioritize landscaping, unlike the simpler, often field-like gardens of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Song and Yuan dynasties, gardens shifted from concrete to abstract, pursuing artistic conception. This mirrored a broader cultural trend. The Song Dynasty prioritized civil over military matters. Though militarily weaker, its economy and culture thrived. The recreational pursuits of later literati fully developed during the Song Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor Huizong of Song, a notable artist, pioneered the use of Taihu stones for garden rockeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Southern Song Dynasty saw a rise in public gardens, allowing ordinary people to experience garden aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yuan Dynasty&amp;rsquo;s key contribution was establishing Yuan Dadu, Beijing&amp;rsquo;s predecessor. The formation of Beijing&amp;rsquo;s core, the water supply from the Western Hills, and the Grand Canal project were all completed during the Yuan Dynasty, laying the groundwork for Ming and Qing imperial gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ming and Qing dynasties shaped China&amp;rsquo;s enduring political and economic landscape. Beijing became the political center, while Jiangnan served as the economic and cultural hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the north of the Ming Dynasty faced frequent wars, Jiangnan prospered. Garden development in Jiangnan remained largely unaffected by political instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, Yangzhou, a Grand Canal hub, thrived on commerce, particularly the salt trade. Yangzhou&amp;rsquo;s gardens were then the most famous, though few survive. Because the owners were primarily merchants, these gardens lacked the prestige of literati gardens. Yangzhou declined with Qing salt reforms and the rise of maritime transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Qing Dynasty, Beijing&amp;rsquo;s imperial gardens flourished, reaching their peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="humble-administrators-garden-zhuozheng-yuan"&gt;Humble Administrator&amp;rsquo;s Garden (Zhuozheng Yuan)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built between 1509 and 1530, during the mid-Ming Dynasty&amp;rsquo;s Zhengde era, the imperial court was declining while the common people enjoyed a period of economic and cultural prosperity. The strict frugality of Zhu Yuanzhang (the first Ming emperor) had faded, allowing for lavish gardens like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Xianchen, the garden&amp;rsquo;s creator, retired from official service in his 40s. He transformed a dilapidated temple, old residences, and low-lying land into his private garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhuozheng Yuan is the largest private garden. It currently covers 78 &lt;em&gt;mu&lt;/em&gt; (about 13 acres), though it was originally 100-200 &lt;em&gt;mu&lt;/em&gt;. Most Suzhou gardens are under 20 &lt;em&gt;mu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden&amp;rsquo;s name comes from the Jin Dynasty&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Idle Dwelling Fu,&amp;rdquo; suggesting that &amp;ldquo;clumsy&amp;rdquo; tasks like gardening are the true path. This reclusive philosophy influenced later private gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Xianchen is a controversial figure. His career declined in middle age, including a prison stint. While praised by literati like Tang Yin and Wen Zhengming, official records paint him as corrupt, suggesting his imprisonment stemmed from graft or factionalism, and that he used family influence to seize the temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhuozheng Yuan&amp;rsquo;s fame is largely due to Wen Zhengming&amp;rsquo;s writings and paintings, especially the &amp;ldquo;Thirty-One Scenes of Zhuozheng Yuan.&amp;rdquo; These records suggest the original garden was more like a vegetable garden, with the intricate landscapes appearing during the Qing Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Xianchen died in his 70s, and his son reportedly gambled away the garden in one night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Qing Dynasty, Zhuozheng Yuan was famous and often housed Suzhou&amp;rsquo;s highest-ranking official. Some believe Cao Xueqin&amp;rsquo;s family (author of &lt;em&gt;Dream of the Red Chamber&lt;/em&gt;) bought part of the garden, inspiring the Grand View Garden&amp;rsquo;s setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Xianfeng era, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Suzhou, and the Loyal King, Li Xiucheng, made Zhuozheng Yuan his palace, even expanding it. After the rebellion, Li Hongzhang, shocked by its extravagance, protected and maintained it. It then returned to being an administrative site, preserving the garden&amp;rsquo;s layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East Garden: The largest (almost half the area), with a rustic landscape and scattered buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Central Garden: The main, most exquisite scenic area. It centers on the Distant Fragrance Hall (Yuanxiang Tang), facing north to a &amp;ldquo;one pond, three mountains&amp;rdquo; layout. This design imitates the mythical mountains of Penglai, Yingzhou, and Fangzhang, a pattern originating in Qin Shi Huang&amp;rsquo;s gardens. The Little Flying Rainbow (Xiao Feihong), a covered bridge, is another highlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;West Garden: For entertainment – music, flowers, and mandarin ducks. A pavilion, &amp;ldquo;With Whom Shall I Sit?&amp;rdquo; (Yu Shui Tong Zuo Xuan), is named after Su Dongpo&amp;rsquo;s line: &amp;ldquo;With whom shall I sit? The bright moon, the cool breeze, and me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhuozheng Yuan, and similar gardens, greatly influenced later ones, making them famous for literary associations. Suzhou&amp;rsquo;s flourishing culture and abundant literati were key. To balance opportunities, the court restricted southern literati&amp;rsquo;s access to officialdom. Those excluded poured their energy into garden art, leading social trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Ming garden development also solidified construction methods. Imitating natural landscapes with endless variations, architectural design broke free from limited functional building types, elevating classical architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lingering-garden-liu-yuan"&gt;Lingering Garden (Liu Yuan)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built during the Ming Dynasty&amp;rsquo;s Wanli era, Liu Yuan is the newest of the major gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 35 &lt;em&gt;mu&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s second only to Zhuozheng Yuan, and much larger than others in Suzhou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three treasures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud-Capped Peak (Guanyun Feng): A Taihu stone, said to be from Emperor Huizong of Song&amp;rsquo;s palace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Five-Peak Immortal Hall (Wufeng Xian Guan): Built with nanmu wood, it&amp;rsquo;s one of only two civilian nanmu halls. Its construction date and the reason for using restricted nanmu are unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rain-Clear Sky Painting (Yu Guo Tian Qing Tu): A stone with natural marble patterns resembling a painting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Yuan&amp;rsquo;s spatial planning is exceptional; its artistic merit is arguably the highest among Suzhou gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Ming Dynasty, it was called East Garden (Dong Yuan). The builder, Xu Taishi, a fourth-rank official like Wang Xianchen, was also an architect. He served as chief of construction in the Ministry of Works, overseeing repairs to Cining Palace and the imperial tombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East Garden wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually east of Suzhou&amp;rsquo;s old city. Xu Taishi&amp;rsquo;s residence was larger; the residential area was west, and the garden area to the east was named East Garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Zhuozheng Yuan, Liu Yuan&amp;rsquo;s location and layout are largely unchanged, preserving the original design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Xu family declined, East Garden was briefly abandoned. During the Qing Dynasty, a new owner, surnamed Liu, renamed it Hanbi Villa (Hanbi Shanzhuang), adding many Taihu stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new owner was a literatus and avid collector of unusual stones. Cloud-Capped Peak was then just outside the northeast corner. Unable to acquire the land, he built a structure to admire it from across the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanbi Villa was one of the few Suzhou gardens to survive the Taiping Rebellion. Afterward, Sheng Xuanhuai&amp;rsquo;s father bought it. The Sheng family adopted the previous owner&amp;rsquo;s surname, Liu, changing it to a homophone (留, &amp;ldquo;linger&amp;rdquo;). They also incorporated Cloud-Capped Peak by expanding the northeast corner. This explains the mostly square Liu Yuan&amp;rsquo;s protruding northeast corner. The garden we see today largely reflects the Sheng family&amp;rsquo;s influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheng Xuanhuai was a key figure in the late Qing Dynasty&amp;rsquo;s Self-Strengthening Movement and a prominent industrialist. He founded Tianjin University and several Jiaotong Universities. As Li Hongzhang&amp;rsquo;s right-hand man, he proposed merchant ships to fund the navy and a telegraph industry, both adopted by Li. Sheng also took advantage of struggles between Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang to crush Hu Xueyan&amp;rsquo;s business empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheng Xuanhuai&amp;rsquo;s industries were vast, including shipping, telecommunications, textiles, education, banking, mining, and public welfare institutions like libraries. He also founded the Red Cross Society of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lion-grove-garden-shizi-lin"&gt;Lion Grove Garden (Shizi Lin)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in 1341, during the late Yuan Dynasty, Shizi Lin began as a Zen temple garden, a place for a high monk&amp;rsquo;s lectures, built by his disciple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;ldquo;Shizi Lin&amp;rdquo; (Lion Grove) honors the monk&amp;rsquo;s lineage. He was a disciple of a monk from Lion Rock (Shizi Yan) on Tianmu Mountain. &amp;ldquo;Lion&amp;rdquo; also symbolizes a high monk in Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a traditional temple, lacking typical Buddhist buildings. It remained primarily a garden, not emphasizing ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ming Dynasty painter Ni Zan visited, helped plan, and painted &amp;ldquo;Shizi Lin Tu,&amp;rdquo; giving it cultural prestige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yao Guangxiao, the monk Daoyan, Zhu Di&amp;rsquo;s advisor, was from Suzhou and reportedly Shizi Lin&amp;rsquo;s abbot. He advised Zhu Di to seize the capital and oversaw Beijing&amp;rsquo;s construction and the Yongle Encyclopedia&amp;rsquo;s compilation. Yao Guangxiao remained a monk, refusing official positions. He later wrote &lt;em&gt;Dao Yu Lu&lt;/em&gt;, criticizing the popular Neo-Confucianism of Cheng and Zhu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the Qing Dynasty, Shizi Lin was a semi-garden, semi-temple. Emperor Qianlong, who loved it, imitated it in the imperial gardens and inscribed the True Delight Pavilion (Zhenqu Ting), giving it royal favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Republic of China period, the Bei family bought and renovated Shizi Lin. I.M. Pei spent part of his childhood here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.M. Pei is a world-renowned architect. His masterpieces include the Louvre Pyramid, the Suzhou Museum, and the Museum of Islamic Art. He deeply understood cross-cultural architectural art. He famously said, &amp;ldquo;Let light do the design.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="canglang-pavilion-surging-wave-pavilion"&gt;Canglang Pavilion (Surging Wave Pavilion)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canglang Pavilion is the oldest documented garden, built in the early Northern Song Dynasty. At that time, the Northern Song hadn&amp;rsquo;t unified the country, and Suzhou was under Wuyue Kingdom rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The builder was a Wuyue military governor, who used it as a private villa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Northern Song Dynasty, the literatus Su Shunqin, facing career setbacks and demotion, came to Suzhou. He bought the garden for 40,000 coins, building Canglang Pavilion. With a literatus&amp;rsquo; endorsement, its fame soared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Southern Song Dynasty, anti-Jin general Han Shizhong lived here, renaming it Han Garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Yuan Dynasty onward, Canglang Pavilion was abandoned. Monks built a temple, which lasted through the Ming Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kangxi&amp;rsquo;s 23rd year, the Jiangsu governor built the Su Gong Shrine (Su Gong祠) on the site to commemorate Su Shunqin. Canglang Pavilion became a public building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kangxi&amp;rsquo;s 34th year, another governor restored Canglang Pavilion nearby. The original was a waterside pavilion; the restoration was a mountain pavilion, built on a rockery. The garden&amp;rsquo;s focus shifted from lake to mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canglang Pavilion was mostly destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion. Today&amp;rsquo;s version is a large-scale Tongzhi era reconstruction, based on the mountain pavilion. The Ming Dynasty appearance is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canglang Pavilion&amp;rsquo;s influence lies in its name and spirit. Su Shunqin took &amp;ldquo;Canglang&amp;rdquo; from a short song: &amp;ldquo;When the waters of Canglang are clear, I can wash my hat tassels. When the waters of Canglang are muddy, I can wash my feet.&amp;rdquo; This reflects a scholar-official&amp;rsquo;s attitude: serve in enlightened times, cultivate oneself in dark ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Su Shunqin invited Ouyang Xiu to write an essay, and Ouyang Xiu wrote: &amp;ldquo;The clear breeze and bright moon are priceless, but sadly they only sold for 40,000 coins.&amp;rdquo; Song Dynasty officials were well-paid; 40,000 coins were about two months&amp;rsquo; salary for a county magistrate. Ouyang Xiu&amp;rsquo;s words further elevated the garden&amp;rsquo;s fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="master-of-the-nets-garden-wangshi-yuan"&gt;Master of the Nets Garden (Wangshi Yuan)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wangshi Yuan was built during the Southern Song Dynasty. The literatus Shi Zhengzhi built a residence, Wanjuan Tang (Ten Thousand Volumes Hall). A small garden with water, Yuyin (Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Retreat), was Wangshi Yuan&amp;rsquo;s predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Qianlong era, retired official Song Zongyuan bought Wanjuan Tang and, inspired by Yuyin, renamed it Wangshi Yuan. Wangshi means &amp;ldquo;fisherman&amp;rdquo; in ancient Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wangshi Yuan changed hands several times and was extensively renovated during the Guangxu era, resulting in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Republic of China period, Zhang Zuolin gave the garden as a birthday gift to his teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Zhang Daqian and his brother, Zhang Shanzi, lived in Wangshi Yuan for four years. Zhang Shanzi, famous for painting tigers, actually kept tigers in the garden. He painted a &amp;ldquo;Flying Tiger&amp;rdquo; for Claire Chennault, the American pilot, and Chennault&amp;rsquo;s squadron became the Flying Tigers (though the exact timeline is unclear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wangshi Yuan&amp;rsquo;s most famous scene is Dianchunyi (Hall of Late Spring), a small, independent courtyard and study in the northwest corner, with a distinct Ming style. &amp;ldquo;Dian&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;behind,&amp;rdquo; Dianchun means late spring (peony season), and &amp;ldquo;yi&amp;rdquo; means small house. The name means &amp;ldquo;a small study in the peony season.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, during the establishment of US-China diplomatic relations, a delegation of American museums visited. A Chinese-American consultant from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, having collected Ming-style furniture, asked Chinese garden master Chen Congzhou how to display it. Chen recommended replicating Dianchunyi. Due to diplomatic factors, the cooperation proceeded smoothly. This marked the first appearance of a Chinese garden in a foreign museum, taking garden culture global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the only place to see a complete Ming-style garden. Because of the brief Tongguang Restoration during the late Qing Dynasty, most gardens were renovated in the more elaborate Qing style. Ming-style gardens have a rustic, scholarly atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zhuozheng Yuan: Largest, most luxurious, Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s Loyal King&amp;rsquo;s palace.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Shizi Lin: Rockeries, Qianlong&amp;rsquo;s inscription, Yao Guangxiao and I.M. Pei.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canglang Pavilion: Oldest, literati spirit, Su Shunqin and Ouyang Xiu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wangshi Yuan: Zhang Shanzi painted tigers, Dianchunyi went global.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鉴于是国庆期间，不太指望拍到什么高质量的照片了。如果真有，回来后会升级成一篇游记。不过八成就这样了，作为一篇笔记，也挺好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;笔记中的内容绝大部分是从一档音频节目 &lt;a class="link" href="http://xima.tv/x2UAWF?_sonic=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;园林里的中国故事&lt;/a&gt; 里听来的，基本是对几个园林直接相关知识的梳理。虽然主讲人我并不熟悉，不过我去考证了其中的部分内容，确实客观真实。主讲人的历史文化底蕴非常深厚，能把相关的信息串联起来，值得完整听一遍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;国际上，园林体系中有3支比较突出。一是中国古典园林，二是欧洲几何式园林，三是日本园林。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中国古典园林体系内，又有3大分支。一是皇家园林，二是江南私家园林，三是岭南园林。其中岭南园林由于古代处在边疆地带，没有足够的文人氛围和财力，园林风格带有民俗特点，自成一派。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中国四大名园是颐和园、承德避暑山庄、拙政园、留园。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沧浪亭、狮子林、拙政园、留园是苏州的四大园林，分别代表宋、元、明、清的园林风格。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="起源与历史"&gt;起源与历史
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;最初的中式园林从秦汉时期开始，伴随中国古代建筑业发展一并出现，不过只是皇家的狩猎园林。在此之前，统治者们也有类似的设施，但不能称作园林，形式主要是台、囿、沼，分别指土台、牧场、鱼池。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;汉武帝时期扩建了上林苑，使它成为有史以来出现过的最大的园林。它除了是动植物园，还是农业基地、矿场、演武场。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;魏晋南北朝时期，中国迎来了春秋战国后的第二次思想解放。在这之前，文人的才华是完全为政治服务的。而魏晋南北朝的300年乱世，使得文人有可能摆脱依附，独立成为一个群体。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;魏晋南北朝时期的皇家园林几乎没有发展。同时文人厌恶了乱世与暴政，开始出现隐居文化，发展自己的理论和独特精神世界，以及园林艺术。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也是在同时，道教兴起，佛教自汉朝传入也在此刻达到一个高峰，所以这一时期也是寺观园林大发展的时期。寺观园林往往选址远离尘嚣，为后世开发了大量名山大川。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;盛唐时期的园林达到了一个高峰，风格奔放华丽。隋唐是中国军事、经济、文化冠绝文明之林的时期，此时的园林以及诗歌等各种文化产物，是文明自信的体现。唐朝最大的皇家园林，比后来的紫禁城还大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;唐朝的花卉栽培技术极其发达，私家园林真正出现了园林的样子，有对景观的追求。不像魏晋南北朝的园林那么古朴，可能真的只是个田园。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宋元时期的园林，园林开始追求意境，由具象转向抽象，不仅是园林，方方面面文化都是如此。宋朝重文抑武，军事相对弱势，但经济和文化非常繁荣，后世文人的各种娱乐活动，在宋朝已经发展完全齐备了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宋徽宗文艺成就极高。正是他开创了用太湖石堆叠假山的园林建造手法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;南宋是公共园林兴起的一个时期，普通百姓也有机会体验园林意境。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;元朝对园林最大贡献是建立元大都，北京城的前身。北京城核心区域的形成，以及西山到城里的供水工程、京杭运河到京城的漕运工程，都是在元朝完成的。为明清两朝的皇家园林准备好了基础设施。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明清朝奠定了中国的政治经济版图，至今未变。以北京为政治中心，江南地区为经济文化中心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明朝北方常有战争，江南则发展得很好。即使政治动荡，江南的园林发展并没有受到太大影响。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明末清初，扬州是大运河的枢纽，是商贸中心，尤其是盐业中心。当时最负盛名的其实是扬州的园林，但没有多少被保留到今天。而且园林主人多为商人，所以没有像文人园林那样得到推崇。随着清朝盐业改革和海运发展，扬州逐渐没落。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;清朝时期，北京的皇家园林大爆发，发展到了极致。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="拙政园"&gt;拙政园
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;拙政园建于1509-1530年间，明朝中期正德年间，正是朝廷开始堕落腐败的时期。但民间却正进入一段繁荣时期，经济和文化开始蓬勃发展。朱元璋立下的节俭的组训，到了这个阶段慢慢被抛弃，所以民间才能建设如此奢华的园林。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拙政园的建立者是王献臣，考中进士，但40多岁就离开了官场，在此隐居。他买下了废弃的寺庙和一些故居以及洼地，整合改造成了私家园林。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拙政园是私家园林里最大的。现在的大小是78亩，它初建成时有100-200亩地。与之相比，苏州常规的园林面积大都不足20亩。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拙政园的名字取自晋代的《闲居赋》，意思是每天浇园种菜的笨拙之事，其实是正道，以拙为政。这种与世无争的隐居思想影响了后世的大部分私家园林。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;王献臣此人褒贬不一，他到中年就开始仕途不顺，进过监狱。他和文人关系很好，唐寅、文征明对他评价都很高。吏部的记录则说他是个贪官，下狱也是因为贪腐或党争，甚至那座废弃寺庙，也是他动用家族势力巧取豪夺来的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拙政园真正出名，是因为文征明为它写了文章、作了画，拙政园三十一景图。根据这些文字和画的记载，最早的拙政园更像个菜园，里面没有这么多精巧的景观，而是菜地果园鱼塘。今天的这些精致的园林景观，到清代才出现。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;王献臣70多岁病故，据说在那之后，他儿子赌博一夜间就把拙政园输给别人了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在清朝，拙政园名气很大，基本都是轮流作为苏州最高官员的住宅。有说法提出，曹雪芹家族曾经也大价钱购买过拙政园的一部分，这里的生活有可能为大观园的设定提供了大量灵感。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;咸丰年间，太平天国占领苏州，忠王李秀成把拙政园变成了忠王府。他还在此基础上大兴土木做了扩建。太平天国失败后，李鸿章对忠王府的奢华表示震惊。李把它保护得很好，不断维护修缮。从那以后，又恢复成行政场所，园林格局一直保持到今天。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拙政园内主要格局：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;东花园区域占地面积最大，将近一半。它最接近初建时的田园山水风貌，建筑都散落在四处，没有连成整体。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;中花园是主要景观区，最为精巧。以远香堂为核心，坐南朝北观看一池三山。一池三山是园林的经典格局，模仿的是东海蓬莱、瀛洲、方丈3座仙山，秦始皇的园林开创了这种格局。小飞鸿也是中花园的一个亮点，这种廊桥的形式也成了许多其他园林的标配。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;西花园是娱乐区域，是听曲赏花赏鸳鸯的地方。这边有个与谁同坐轩，名称取自苏东坡的一句词：“与谁同坐，明月，清风，我。”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拙政园以及同时期的园林，对后世园林影响非常大，奠定了园以文名的基调。出现这种趋势，一个重要原因是古苏州文化太发达，文人太多。为了平衡全国各地的仕途机会，朝廷设定了诸多限制机制，例如科举分南北榜录取。因此苏州文人入仕比例其实很有限。没当上官的，就把精力和才华投入到园林艺术与这种生活方式中，并且引领了社会风尚。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明末的园林艺术发展，也沉淀了园林建设的体系方法。格局模仿自然山水，布局千变万化。让建筑设计突破当时民间少数几种单调的功能型建筑，开启了建筑艺术的新可能，使古典建筑业上了个大台阶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="留园"&gt;留园
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;留园建于明万历年间。是主要园林中最晚建成的一座。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;面积35亩，仅次于拙政园，比苏州其余园林大很多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;留园镇园三宝：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;冠云峰。一块太湖石，据说是宋徽宗的宫廷遗物。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;五峰仙馆。这是楠木建成的，民间只有两处楠木殿，这是其中之一。它是什么时期建的，为什么能用逾制的楠木造殿，目前无法考证。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;雨过天晴图。一块奇石，大理石纹路天然带有图画。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;留园的空间规划是一绝，可以说它的艺术成就是苏州园林里最高的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在明代，它叫东园。建设者叫徐泰时，大致是个四品官员，和拙政园的王献臣差不多。他本身就是个建筑师，当过工部营建主事，主修过慈宁宫和皇陵。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实际上东园的位置并不在苏州古城的东边。当时徐泰时的府邸比留园更大些，西边还有一片是住宅，东边的园林区才起名为东园。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;与拙政园不同，留园的位置、格局从古至今没有发生太大变化，基本保持了建立时的格局。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;徐泰时家族衰落后，东园荒废了一段时间。在清代，东园一位新的刘姓主人给它改名为寒碧山庄，往园内加入了许多太湖石。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个新主人也是文人，而且是狂热的奇石爱好者。当时冠云峰并不在园内，恰恰就在东北角墙外一点。但他也不能强占那块地，只好在园内建了座建筑，经常隔墙欣赏它。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;太平天国时期，寒碧山庄是苏州极为罕见未遭破坏的园林。起义平定后，盛宣怀的父亲买下了寒碧山庄。盛宣怀家族取了上任主人的刘姓，改同音字留，作为新的名字。而且还特意把园子东北角扩出去一点，将冠云峰并入园内。所以基本上方正的留园，在地图上看可以发现东北角突出了一点。今天看到的留园，基本都是盛氏家族传承下来的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;盛宣怀是清末洋务运动代表人物，实业家。天津大学和几个交通大学的创始人。他也是李鸿章的得力助手，他提出通过建造商船筹措水师军费、建立电报业，都被李鸿章采纳。在后期李鸿章与左宗棠的争斗中，盛宣怀也借势击垮了胡雪岩的商业帝国。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;盛宣怀的产业几乎无所不包，涉及航运、电讯、纺织、教育、银行、矿产，以及图书馆等公共福利事业。中国红十字会也是他创立的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="狮子林"&gt;狮子林
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;狮子林建于元代末年，1341年。先是一座禅寺园林，是一位高僧的徒弟为他建的讲经场所。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;狮子林得名体现这位高僧衣钵传承，他师承浙江天目山狮子岩的另一位高僧，沿用了狮子一词纪念自己的师傅。另外狮子是佛教中的重要意象，有高僧的含义。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但这并不是一座传统意义的寺庙，没有那些佛教建筑和设施，仍是以园林为主，不讲究佛教的各种仪式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明朝画家倪瓒造访狮子林，参与了狮子林的规划，并画了狮子林图，赋予了狮子林文化气息，使它声名远扬。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;朱棣的谋士，道衍和尚姚广孝就是苏州人，据说在狮子林当过住持。就是他建议朱棣夺权时直取京师，他还主持了北京城的建设和永乐大典的编撰。姚广孝一生都只是和尚，没有接受朱棣赐的任何官职。他晚年写了作品《道余录》抨击当时盛行的程朱理学，没有得到亲戚朋友的理解。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;直到清朝，狮子林还是半园林半寺庙的状态。乾隆很喜欢狮子林，曾经在皇家园林里模仿了狮子林，还为其中的真趣亭题名，使得狮子林沾了皇家气质，名气大增。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;民国时期，贝氏家族购买并重新修整了狮子林。贝聿铭童年有段时间就在这里生活。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;贝聿铭是享誉世界的建筑大师。代表作是卢浮宫、苏州博物馆、伊斯兰艺术博物馆。可见他能够深刻理解各不同文化的建筑艺术。他有句名言：让光线来做设计。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="沧浪亭"&gt;沧浪亭
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;沧浪亭是有记载传承下来历史最悠久的园林，建于北宋初年。其实此时北宋还未统一全国，苏州仍在五代十国中吴越国的统治范围内。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;建造者是吴越国的一个节度使，作为私人别墅。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;北宋期间，文人苏舜钦仕途不顺被贬斥，来到苏州。他喜欢这个园林，花四万钱就买了下来，建了沧浪亭和其他设施。有文人加持，沧浪亭名声大噪。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;南宋期间，抗金将领韩世忠在此居住，改名为韩园。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;元朝开始，沧浪亭已经被废弃。有僧人在此建了寺庙，一直持续了整个明朝。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;康熙23年，江苏巡抚在沧浪亭遗址建了苏公祠，纪念苏舜钦。沧浪亭就变成了公共建筑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;康熙34年，另一名巡抚在遗址附近复原了沧浪亭。以前的沧浪亭是水亭，临水而建。复原后变成了山亭，建在假山上。园林的中心由湖变成了山。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;太平天国战争中，沧浪亭基本都毁坏了。今天看到的沧浪亭，是同治年间一次大规模重建的结果。重建仍是按照山亭来建，已经无法展现明朝时期的风貌。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沧浪亭的影响力主要在于它的名字和精神内涵。苏舜钦从一首无法考证的短歌中取了沧浪二字：沧浪之水清兮，可以濯我缨。沧浪之水浊兮，可以濯我足。这是士大夫对时政的典型态度：官场开明，兼济天下；官场黑暗，独善其身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;苏舜钦还邀请欧阳修为沧浪亭作文，欧阳修留下了名句：清风明月本无价，可惜只卖四万钱。宋代政府官员收入很高，四万钱大约只是一个县令2月工资。欧阳修此句一出，使沧浪亭名气更上一个台阶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="网师园"&gt;网师园
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;网师园建于南宋。文人史正志在此建宅，名为万卷堂。其中有个带水的小花园叫渔隐，是网师园的前身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;到乾隆年间，退休的宋宗元买了万卷堂，沿用渔隐的含义，改名网师园。网师就是古文中渔夫的意思。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后来网师园几经易主，光绪年间经过一次大规模修缮，成了今天的样子。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;民国时期，张作霖买了这座园子。把它作为寿礼送给了他老师。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;抗战时期，张大千与他二哥张善孖曾经在网师园住过4年。张善孖也是画家，画老虎非常有名。这4年间，园里真的养了老虎供他们画。张善孖画过一副飞虎图，送给美国援华空军陈纳德，而陈纳德的编队就称为飞虎队，只是不确定两件事的时间顺序。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;网师园最出名的景观是西北角的殿春簃，是一个独立院落小书斋，有鲜明的明式园林风范。这个名字里的殿不是建筑，而是殿后的意思，殿春，春末开芍药；簃字指小屋。所以名字意思是芍药季的小书斋。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中美建交时期，1978年，美国博物馆代表团来中国访问。其中纽约大都会博物馆有一个华裔顾问，找到中国的园林研究大家陈从周，说他们收集了一些明式家具，问应该用一个什么样的空间来展示。陈从周推荐他们复刻殿春簃，再加上外交政治上的因素，合作执行非常顺利。这是中国园林第一次出现在国外的博物馆中，园林文化第一次走向世界。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;即使到今天，大都会博物馆也是唯一能完整展示明式园林的地方。因为晚清的同治和光绪年间有一次短暂的盛世，同光中兴，大多数园林都在那期间重新修缮，变为了清式园林。清式园林更多精巧和雕琢，不像明式园林那样具有田园与书卷气。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="总结"&gt;总结
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;提炼一下几个园林的看点&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;拙政园：最大，最豪华，太平天国忠王府&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;留园：最晚，保存最完好，艺术成就最高，盛宣怀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;狮子林：假山群，乾隆题字，姚广孝与贝聿铭&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;沧浪亭：最早，文人精神，苏舜钦与欧阳修&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;网师园：张善孖画虎，殿春簃走向世界&lt;/li&gt;

Over breakfast, I watched the intersection below for nearly half an hour. From the 9th floor, it&amp;rsquo;s a completely different view than driving. You see the collective driver reactions, how tiny decisions ripple outwards. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating, chaotic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During rush hour, the intersection twice became a &amp;ldquo;mahjong table&amp;rdquo;—traffic in each direction jammed against another. Four streams of cars formed a kind of windmill, like a mahjong game&amp;rsquo;s starting setup. I thought it was hopeless, only solvable by a traffic cop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jam was massive. One direction alone was three lanes wide, buses included. The line blocking &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; probably stretched to the next intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this &amp;ldquo;mahjong table&amp;rdquo; cleared in 20 minutes. How? First, southbound traffic backed up from the next light (imagine this cascading down the line – that&amp;rsquo;s why jams move on navigation apps). The light turned green, southbound cars kept coming, blocking the intersection and halting westbound traffic. Westbound traffic then blocked northbound. Crucially, the southbound flow wasn&amp;rsquo;t constant; it crept forward. That&amp;rsquo;s where things fell apart. If a single car lagged, impatient eastbound drivers, pressured by the queue behind (even without honking), would cut in, knowing it&amp;rsquo;d worsen the jam. Eastbound traffic, blocked by northbound, in turn blocked southbound. The &amp;ldquo;mahjong table&amp;rdquo; was set – a self-destructive loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later, the lanes cleared, but the central knot remained. A bus driver stuck his head out, trying to direct, but no one budged. Even scooters were stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did it untangle? After 10 minutes of gridlock, drivers got restless. Initially, it was all about gaining an inch. But, at a certain point, a few drivers led the change, everyone&amp;rsquo;s behavior flipped. They realized they had to yield to avoid a lose-lose, or maybe the cost became too high. Cars started making right turns or U-turns, taking detours. The knot shrank from three lanes to two, then one, finally dissolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers were noticeably friendlier during the untangling. No more aggressive cutting in; they let stragglers merge. People are more cooperative when they&amp;rsquo;re in better spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving reveals human nature. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly instinct, little logic. Everyone has limited information, judging from just a few nearby cars. It&amp;rsquo;s like first-order chaos; people don&amp;rsquo;t predict the outcome, and even if they could, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Without external input, most drivers switched from competition to cooperation in under 20 minutes. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a sight, really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>十字路口的麻将桌</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3589/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 10:36:57 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3589/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;今天很早到公司，一边吃早餐，一边居高临下观察十字路口近半个小时。从9楼的高度望下去，是一种与平时开车完全不同的视角。可以观察司机们在混乱中作为一个整体如何反应。每个人细微的决策，又会如何影响整体。这是个很有意思的混沌系统。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上班高峰期间，十字路口两次堵成麻将桌。所谓麻将桌，就是每个方向的直行车流，都顶着另一个方向车流的侧面。4股车流形成了一个像风车一样的结构，就像麻将开局摸牌前的摆法。在我想象中，这样的局面除非交警来，否则无法解开，是个死局。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;要知道，今天这个线团缠到最大的状态，单一个方向的车流就堵了3个车道宽，其中还夹杂着几辆公交车和大巴。而挡住它的另一队车流，队尾估计可以一路延伸到下一个红绿灯。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是意外的是，麻将桌居然在20分钟内自行解开了。不过首先，这样的局面是如何造成的？先是南向北的去向道路堵死，从下一个红绿灯一路堵到这个路口（可以想象同样的事情从下个路口一路传导到这里来，并且也会继续传导到相邻的路口，这就是为什么堵车路段会在导航App上移动和扩散）。当信号灯变绿灯时，南向北的车流继续跟上，堵住路口，把西向东的车流挡住。西向东车流又把北向南车流挡住。然后，关键来了！南向北方向并不是铁板一块，总能时不时往前挪一挪。这一挪就完蛋了。只要车流中有一辆车没跟上，东向西的车流等太久，心情焦急，尤其前排车顶不住后面长龙给他造成的心理压力（哪怕没有任何人鸣笛），明知此举会加重堵车，他依然会插进来。东向西车流被北向南车流挡住，同时又挡住南向北车流。麻将桌正式形成，以一种类似于五行相克的方式父相伤害。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实际上，5分钟后，各个方向的去向道路已经疏通，但这个线团仍然结结实实挡在路口中央。我甚至看到公交车司机探出头来，他视野开阔，试图指挥其他人共同解开线团，但是所有车无动于衷，因为完全动不了。连外卖小哥的电瓶车都穿不过去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;它又是怎么解开的呢？毫无动静10分钟后，每个司机的焦虑情绪逐渐上升。原先在这场博弈中，大家都患得患失，只争不让。过了某个特定时间点，再加上少数人带头行动，所有人的行为忽然发生180度大转弯。大家可能都意识到彼此需要做一些退让，来避免这个双输局面，或者仅仅是因为成本过高等不起了。于是各个方向开始有车右转或掉头，原本直行的车决定绕路。线团半径从3个车道变成2个车道，然后变成1个车道，最后解开。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而且明显可以观察到的是，在线团解开的过程中，司机的行为变得友好了许多。不会在位置处于劣势时强行抢道，也更愿意让落单的车辆先走。心情好的时候人更倾向于合作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开车是最能体现人本性的场合之一，几乎不怎么需要调动逻辑思考，都凭本能做决策。每个人能接收到的信息又非常有限，只能通过前后左右少量车来判断当前局面。虽然有人的参与，但这更像是一阶混沌，参与者不会去预测结果，即使预测也改变不了什么。在没有任何外部信息输入的情况下，多数人的策略从竞争变为合作，就只发生在短短不到20分钟的时间内。不得不说这也是一种奇观，非常有趣。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>文化与行事风格</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3586/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 21:55:46 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3586/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;开了个恒生银行香港账户，从下午1点办到了5点。整个过程大概是先提交内地账户材料并核验，再提交香港账户材料并核验，最后签理财或保险购买协议。内地账户办得快，大部分时间花在香港账户上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开办之前，内地客户经理已经和我吐槽过，说他很受不了香港的客户经理，你一会儿就能领教了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;即使有预防针，实际情况还是出乎我的意料。香港那边的客户经理严谨到变态，我们提交过去的材料一次次被打回来。而且坚持每次来电只解决一个问题，下一个问题要再打一次电话过来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;问题大都很细节。比如港澳通行证复印件为什么有条奇怪的线啊（复印机玻璃有划痕），日期年份格式别写2020应该写20啊，客户工作单位是XX文化传播有限公司为什么不是娱乐行业却是教育行业啊……我看到大陆客户经理白眼都翻到天上去了。业务办完，他长舒一口气，我说这经历我一定印象深刻，他哈哈一笑，一顿猛点头。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中间等回复的间隙，客户经理跟我聊起来。我说他们是不是只有工作时这样？像个机器人。他说没错就像机器人，不过不止工作时这样。以往来办业务的香港客户，文件上每个字都要看得清清楚楚。台湾的客户又很不一样，不会那么仔细，但很喜欢和你各种客套。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个下午业务办下来，也算是长见识了。这里并没有贬低任何一方的意思，因为各种行事风格背后肯定有深厚的文化原因，是一群人整体的文化性格。在当地像空气一样理所当然，放到另一个文化中就格格不入。不同文化间差异如此巨大又微妙，今天算是有了第一手的认识，与以往的道听途说感觉很不一样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;挺好玩的，无它。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>4 Days 5 Nights in Beijing</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3580/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 18:03:29 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3580/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-20-16.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 4 Days 5 Nights in Beijing" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a long travelogue, around 10,000 words. Feel free to just skim the pictures if you&amp;rsquo;re not up for reading it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my third trip to Beijing. The first time, I was too young to remember much. The second time, I skipped the historical sites and went straight to the Military Museum. This time, I finally explored the city, and it left a lasting impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-20-51-02.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before leaving, I pictured the cockroaches in my house, hiding in every nook and cranny, planning a five-day party the moment I was gone. I opened my train ticket, my finger hovering over the refund button, a sly smile on my face. Suddenly, the house was filled with tiny wails and cries of despair: &amp;ldquo;No, no, no!&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Stop&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Oh s**t!&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; One particularly dramatic roach even did a front flip, splitting its cookie crumb in two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough of that. I left anyway; let them have their fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went straight to the high-speed rail station after work and arrived in Beijing that night. It was surprisingly quick, just 4.5 hours from Hangzhou. The trip was 4 days and 5 nights, during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The weather was perfect, with no rain during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1-the-central-axis-and-east-side-of-the-forbidden-city"&gt;Day 1: The Central Axis and East Side of the Forbidden City
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="beijing-city"&gt;Beijing City
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Emperor Yongle moved the capital to Beijing, he had a grand vision for the city. Beijing was designed with the Forbidden City at its heart, divided into four layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The innermost layer is the Palace City, the Forbidden City, now the Palace Museum. It runs from the Meridian Gate (Wumen) in the south to the Gate of Divine Prowess (Shenwumen) in the north. The &amp;ldquo;Zi&amp;rdquo; (紫) in &amp;ldquo;Zijincheng&amp;rdquo; (Forbidden City) refers to the Purple Star, or Polaris. Because Polaris appears fixed in the sky, with other stars revolving around it, it symbolizes the emperor. The &amp;ldquo;Jin&amp;rdquo; (禁) means forbidden, heavily guarded, and off-limits. Ming and Qing law decreed that commoners trespassing into the Imperial City would be caned 100 times and exiled 3,000 li. Those trespassing into the Palace City faced hanging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside the Palace City is the Imperial City, stretching from Tian&amp;rsquo;anmen in the south to Di&amp;rsquo;anmen in the north. The Imperial City housed most of those who served the emperor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further out is the Inner City, roughly the area of today&amp;rsquo;s Beijing Subway Line 2. That&amp;rsquo;s why most Line 2 station names are gates (&amp;ldquo;men&amp;rdquo;). This was where ordinary people could live; even princes and ministers&amp;rsquo; residences were limited to this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s the Outer City. Initially a small area on the south side, it expanded as the city grew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-20-35-38.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing is laid out along a central axis running through these four layers. The Forbidden City, and even the dragon throne in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, sits on this axis, emphasizing &amp;ldquo;centeredness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;righteousness.&amp;rdquo; The grid-like road network of modern Beijing is a legacy of Emperor Yongle&amp;rsquo;s design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-gates-of-the-forbidden-city"&gt;The Gates of the Forbidden City
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-20-38-54.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palace Museum entrance is at Tian&amp;rsquo;anmen. Going inward, you pass through Duanmen Gate and the Meridian Gate (Wumen) before entering the Forbidden City. Outside Tian&amp;rsquo;anmen, there were two more gates: Daqingmen and Zhengyangmen. Daqingmen, called Damingmen during the Ming Dynasty, was the &amp;ldquo;Gate of the Nation.&amp;rdquo; It was demolished during the construction of Tian&amp;rsquo;anmen Square. Zhengyangmen, also known as Qianmen (Front Gate), was mainly for defense. It once had a barbican and arrow tower, but only the gate tower and arrow tower remain; the barbican was torn down during the Republican period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On either side of Tian&amp;rsquo;anmen are pairs of stone &lt;em&gt;hou&lt;/em&gt; (a mythical beast) on &lt;em&gt;huabiao&lt;/em&gt; (ornamental columns). The inner ones are called &lt;em&gt;Wang Jun Chu&lt;/em&gt; (Looking for the Emperor to Go Out), meaning the emperor should go out and understand his people&amp;rsquo;s suffering. The outer ones are called &lt;em&gt;Wang Jun Gui&lt;/em&gt; (Looking for the Emperor to Return), meaning the emperor should return and govern diligently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor: What more do you want?!

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gate opening of Duanmen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Meridian Gate appears to have three openings but actually has five. From afar, you only see three, but two more are hidden on the sides. This, like the bridges over the Golden Water River, reflects a strict hierarchy. The central gate was for the emperor, though the empress could use it once during the imperial wedding, and the top three scholars in the imperial examination could use it once when leaving. The two side gates were for imperial relatives. The outermost gates were for officials, civil on the left and military on the right (from the emperor&amp;rsquo;s perspective, facing south). The Hall of Literary Glory (Wenhua Dian) on the east and the Hall of Military Eminence (Wuying Dian) on the west – the entire layout of the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s outer court followed this &amp;ldquo;civil on the left, military on the right&amp;rdquo; principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/VID_20190913_102951.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Meridian Gate has walls on three sides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back from inside the Meridian Gate, you can see Duanmen and Tian&amp;rsquo;anmen&amp;rsquo;s gate openings. Further out is the Monument to the People&amp;rsquo;s Heroes. If Daqingmen still existed, you&amp;rsquo;d see its gate openings, and Zhengyangmen&amp;rsquo;s, too. Five gates in a line – a powerful symbol of the emperor&amp;rsquo;s authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Meridian Gate is the Gate of Supreme Harmony (Taihemen). Although just a gate, it&amp;rsquo;s grander than most Forbidden City buildings. It caught fire during Emperor Guangxu&amp;rsquo;s reign, coinciding with his wedding. Protocol dictated the empress pass through it. Someone suggested a temporary paper gate, so realistic that palace staff couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell the difference. This paper gate was used for six years until the real gate was rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bronze lions in front of the Gate of Supreme Harmony&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-outer-court"&gt;The Outer Court
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The square between the Gate of Supreme Harmony and the Hall of Supreme Harmony (Taihedian) is the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s most open space, yet it has no trees. This grand, artificial landscape was designed to create a sense of awe and pressure on officials attending court, demonstrating the emperor&amp;rsquo;s majesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hall of Supreme Harmony is the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious building, over 2,200 square meters, supported by 72 &lt;em&gt;nanmu&lt;/em&gt; wood pillars. Its roof is the highest level in ancient architecture: a double-eaved, hipped roof. This type of roof, with its curved slopes, was usually reserved for the emperor. Double eaves were also forbidden for commoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hall of Supreme Harmony has burned down four times, during the reigns of Yongle, Jiajing, Wanli, and Kangxi. Being made of wood, it was highly susceptible to fire. The first two fires were caused by lightning; the latter two spread from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire during Jiajing&amp;rsquo;s reign is interesting. During reconstruction, Jiajing and his ministers discussed the cause and prevention. Without knowledge of lightning rods, they blamed the name. The original name, Fengtian Dian (奉天殿), had the characters written vertically, with &amp;ldquo;Feng&amp;rdquo; (奉) above &amp;ldquo;Tian&amp;rdquo; (天), potentially displeasing Heaven. Someone suggested writing it horizontally, enlarging &amp;ldquo;Tian.&amp;rdquo; Jiajing&amp;rsquo;s response: &amp;ldquo;Not elegant&amp;rdquo; – basically, &amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;rdquo;! They renamed it Huangji Dian (皇极殿), with &amp;ldquo;Huang&amp;rdquo; (皇) on top. The name Taihe Dian (太和殿) came during the Qing Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiajing: Make the logo bigger, follow your idea, make it international, when can I see it?

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the name change, many fire prevention measures were taken, mostly based on feng shui. The only practical measure was placing large water vats throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-25-57.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A water vat in the Imperial Garden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hall of Supreme Harmony was mainly for grand ceremonies, like enthronements, weddings, and military expeditions. However, due to fires and other reasons, few ceremonies actually occurred here. Only half of the 14 Ming emperors were enthroned here. Only six emperors (Zhengde, Wanli, Shunzhi, Kangxi, Tongzhi, and Guangxu) held their weddings (first marriages of young emperors) here. Only Kangxi held a military expedition ceremony here, before fighting Galdan. Emperors Zhengde and Jiajing went on expeditions, but skipped the formalities, ignoring ministers&amp;rsquo; objections. Emperor Zhengde suffered a defeat at the Tumu Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East of the Hall of Supreme Harmony is Tiren Ge (Hall of Embodied Benevolence), a quiet area with few visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-29-49.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Kangxi&amp;rsquo;s reign, the &lt;em&gt;Boxue Hongru&lt;/em&gt; examination was held here. This was a special talent selection, outside the regular imperial examination. Talented individuals were recommended nationwide. The &lt;em&gt;Boxue Hongru&lt;/em&gt; exam was much better than the regular one: candidates had tables and chairs, no time limit, candles to continue after dark, and a luxurious dinner (400 taels of silver per table, compared to a county magistrate&amp;rsquo;s annual salary of ~60 taels). Fifty out of 130+ candidates were admitted, treated like top imperial examination scholars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hall of Central Harmony (Zhonghedian) behind it is square with a round, gilded roof, reflecting the &amp;ldquo;round heaven, square earth&amp;rdquo; worldview. At times, the roof reflects sunlight onto the Erlang Temple, which people attributed to divine manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hall of Central Harmony served as the emperor&amp;rsquo;s resting place before ceremonies and hosted small banquets and meetings. Before the Ming Dynasty fell, Emperor Chongzhen&amp;rsquo;s last meeting was held here, where ministers offered little useful advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Outer Court&amp;rsquo;s last building is the Hall of Preserving Harmony (Baohedian). Emperors Shunzhi and Kangxi lived here. &amp;ldquo;Hall&amp;rdquo; (dian) signifies state affairs; &amp;ldquo;palace&amp;rdquo; (gong), family affairs. Shunzhi initially lived in the Palace of Heavenly Purity (Qianqinggong), but it was in disrepair, so he stayed in the Hall of Preserving Harmony, renaming it a palace (Weiyu Gong, then Qingning Gong during Kangxi&amp;rsquo;s stay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t get good pictures of the Hall of Central Harmony and the Hall of Preserving Harmony. This area is very crowded. The emperors watched officials shout &amp;ldquo;Long live the Emperor.&amp;rdquo; What would they think of today&amp;rsquo;s tourists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor: Guards!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-inner-court"&gt;The Inner Court
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gate of Heavenly Purity (Qianqingmen) divides the Outer Court&amp;rsquo;s Three Halls and the Inner Court&amp;rsquo;s Three Palaces. The Palace of Heavenly Purity area forms a courtyard, including the Palace of Heavenly Purity (Qianqinggong), the Hall of Union and Peace (Jiaotaidian), and the Palace of Earthly Tranquility (Kunninggong). Originally, these were the emperor&amp;rsquo;s residence, a place for rituals, and the empress&amp;rsquo;s residence, respectively. But starting from the Inner Court, they often weren&amp;rsquo;t used as intended. Yongzheng moved to the Hall of Mental Cultivation (Yangxindian), the Palace of Earthly Tranquility became a place for sacrifices, and Cixi lived in the Western Six Palaces. Rules were often bent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palace of Heavenly Purity has a plaque reading &amp;ldquo;Zhengda Guangming&amp;rdquo; (Justice and Honor). Starting with Yongzheng, to reduce infighting, a secret succession system was used. The emperor wrote a will, kept one copy, and hid another behind the plaque. After his death, the copies were compared for succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a magical photo in the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. The old-style glass reflects colorful light. The interior is dim, and the glass reflects the sky with stunning colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the Three Palaces is the Imperial Garden, which is smaller than Prince Gong&amp;rsquo;s private garden. Of course, this is unfair; the imperial leisure areas included the Summer Palace, Yuanmingyuan, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenes in the Imperial Garden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exiting the Imperial Garden, you reach the Gate of Divine Prowess (Shenwumen), the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s north gate. The imperial family&amp;rsquo;s female members used this gate for outings; the emperor used the Meridian Gate, and they&amp;rsquo;d meet later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-35-29.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gate of Divine Prowess was previously Xuanwumen. Traditional culture associates four divine beasts with directions: Green Dragon (east), White Tiger (west), Vermilion Bird (south), and Black Tortoise (Xuanwu, north). Xuanwumen often referred to a north gate. To avoid Emperor Kangxi&amp;rsquo;s taboo name, Xuanye (玄烨), it became Shenwumen (神武门).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="east-side-of-the-forbidden-city"&gt;East Side of the Forbidden City
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the central axis. We then headed south from the Inner Court&amp;rsquo;s eastern part, visiting the Six Eastern Palaces. I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with imperial harem history, and I can&amp;rsquo;t remember which concubine lived where. The most memorable was the popular Yanxi Palace, with a water palace. I initially thought it was a fire ruin, but the guide explained it was unfinished. Yanxi Palace had multiple fires. Consort Jin (or possibly Empress Dowager Longyu) commissioned a Western-style crystal palace, to suppress fire and enjoy fish. It had a pool with goldfish and a glass floor. Due to financial constraints, it was halted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-37-44.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If completed, the underwater level would have resembled modern ocean parks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South of the Six Eastern Palaces is the Archery Pavilion (Jianting). Jianting&amp;rsquo;s spacious interior was used for archery and martial arts practice, and hosted military examinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-39-20.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weapons and armor of the Eight Banners army were displayed inside Jianting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saddle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing south, east of Xiehe Gate, is the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s most tranquil area. The Wenhua Dian complex is hidden behind trees. The two main buildings are Wenhua Dian (Hall of Literary Glory) and Wenyuan Ge (Hall of Literary Profundity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-54-19.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tree-lined path east of Xiehe Gate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Three Great Halls burned down, Wenhua Dian temporarily served as the emperor&amp;rsquo;s office. After their reconstruction, it became the crown prince&amp;rsquo;s office. Therefore, the roof couldn&amp;rsquo;t use yellow glazed tiles and was downgraded to green. Emperor Jiajing later converted Wenhua Dian for his own use, hence the yellow roof today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-54-40.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wenhua Dian hosted &amp;ldquo;Jingyan&amp;rdquo; (Classics Mat lectures), where Grand Scholars taught the emperor Confucian classics, shaping his worldview. This was crucial for young emperors. Zhang Juzheng taught young Wanli, and Weng Tonghe taught young Guangxu here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Guangxu&amp;rsquo;s first lesson, Weng Tonghe taught calligraphy (&amp;ldquo;Tianxia Taiping, Zhengda Guangming&amp;rdquo; - Peace under Heaven, Justice and Honor). Guangxu got bored, so Weng switched to storytelling, using Zhang Juzheng&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Dijian Tushuo&amp;rdquo; (Illustrated Mirror for Emperors). Guangxu&amp;rsquo;s interest waned. Weng then made him read aloud, repeatedly. Guangxu refused. Weng criticized him harshly, and Guangxu walked out. Scolded by Cixi, he returned. As he grew older, Guangxu became more cooperative and respected his teacher, consulting him on important decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guangxu: Pfft~ I&amp;rsquo;m still a baby.
&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-53-43.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East of Wenhua Dian is Chuanxin Dian (Hall of Passing on the Mind), enshrining figures like Fuxi, Nuwa, Shennong, Xuanyuan, Yao, Shun, Yu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius. This building appeared during the Qing Dynasty, demonstrating its acceptance of Han culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the north, Wenyuan Ge looks ancient. It was the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s imperial library, once holding important classics like the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library in Four Sections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-42-08.jpg"

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="inner-court---east-side"&gt;Inner Court - East Side
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After entering the Meridian Gate, we headed straight for Huangji Dian, a &amp;ldquo;city within a city&amp;rdquo; known as the Inner Court&amp;rsquo;s Outer Eastern Road. The Nine Dragon Screen stands before the courtyard gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-56-59.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huangji Gate, facing the Nine Dragon Screen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courtyard mirrors the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s central axis. Qianlong built this garden for his retirement. He abdicated after 60 years on the throne, becoming Emperor Emeritus, honoring his promise not to exceed Kangxi&amp;rsquo;s 61-year reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qianlong: Buy low, sell high, and quit while you&amp;rsquo;re ahead~

&lt;p&gt;The dragon throne in Huangji Dian. Qianlong&amp;rsquo;s retirement certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t cramp his style. This photo practically has its own soundtrack – you can almost hear the theme song of &amp;ldquo;The Qianlong Dynasty&amp;rdquo;! Ah, Adam Cheng!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-22-14-44-00.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huangji Dian&amp;rsquo;s courtyard now houses the Palace Museum&amp;rsquo;s Treasure Gallery. I&amp;rsquo;m no expert, but these lavish artworks were instantly captivating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/zhenbao-yushi.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 gold artifacts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the courtyard lies the rest and recreation area. Changyin Ge (Pavilion of Pleasant Sounds), the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s largest theater, stands out. It has three levels, with Qianlong watching performances from the opposing Yue Shi Lou (Tower for Viewing). Actors used vertical passages to move between levels, appearing from below or descending from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-00-23-59.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;Leshou Tang (Hall of Joyful Longevity), once Cixi&amp;rsquo;s residence, has a subdued, aged feel compared to the vibrant Inner Court&amp;rsquo;s Three Palaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walls display calligraphy and paintings gifted by ministers, reflecting her power. She also resided in a Leshou Tang at the Summer Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-00-24-34.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the backyard&amp;rsquo;s north end is a well. Nobody dared drink Forbidden City well water. During Yongle Emperor&amp;rsquo;s reign, bored eunuchs and palace maids sometimes formed unofficial couples. Disgusted by seeing one such couple, Yongle ordered the execution of all paired eunuchs and maids, throwing them into the wells. The number of bodies in the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s wells remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhu Di: Bro, it&amp;rsquo;s fine! Drink up!
&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-59-32.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consort Zhen, Guangxu&amp;rsquo;s favorite, famously died in a well. Cixi arranged Guangxu&amp;rsquo;s marriage to Empress Longyu, but Guangxu disliked her, finding her plain and unremarkable. He favored the lively and intelligent Consort Zhen. She embraced Western ideas and supported Guangxu&amp;rsquo;s reforms, angering Cixi. When the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded, Cixi fled, ordering Consort Zhen thrown into the well behind Huangji Dian before leaving. The well was renamed Zhenfei Jing (Consort Zhen Well). Guangxu was reportedly never the same, withdrawing from the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the Inner Court&amp;rsquo;s Outer Eastern Road, we returned to Shenwumen (Gate of Divine Prowess). We climbed the Forbidden City wall and walked the eastern section. Taihe Dian (Hall of Supreme Harmony) clearly stands as the tallest building, its roof style distinctly superior. Most lower buildings feature hip roofs with small vertical gables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several views on the city wall, the building in the picture is not Taihe Dian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northeast Corner Tower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also photographed a small courtyard in a restricted area, resembling the workshop from the documentary &amp;ldquo;Masters in Forbidden City.&amp;rdquo; My wife and I agreed it was likely the same place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-00-26-49.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="forbidden-city---west-side"&gt;Forbidden City - West Side
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After descending, we passed Wenhua Dian and crossed Taihemen Square to reach Wuying Dian (Hall of Military Eminence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-20-55-07.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taihemen Square&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;literature on the left, military on the right&amp;rdquo; design, Wuying Dian primarily served literary purposes. Except for the Ming-Qing transition, when Li Zicheng and Dorgon handled affairs here, it mostly functioned as the royal publishing house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South of Wuying Dian lies Jiyongchu (literally &amp;ldquo;Exciting Bucket Place&amp;rdquo;), the ancient fire brigade&amp;rsquo;s location. The term &amp;ldquo;fire brigade&amp;rdquo; existed during the Guangxu period. They used a syringe-like device called a &amp;ldquo;jitong&amp;rdquo; (exciting bucket) to spray water several meters. Wuying Dian&amp;rsquo;s fire brigade was the earliest dedicated firefighting organization, a precursor to modern fire brigades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jitong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Wuying Dian, we bypassed the Three Great Halls to reach Cining Gong (Palace of Compassion and Tranquility), the residence of empress dowagers and imperial concubines – much grander than the concubines&amp;rsquo; quarters. A Buddhist hall stood behind Cining Gong, reflecting the empress dowagers&amp;rsquo; faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second courtyard of Cining Gong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The western building of the second courtyard of Cining Gong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South of Cining Gate is a long, narrow garden, almost as large as the Imperial Garden, but less refined and dynamic, feeling stiff and monotonous – more like a park for seniors than a garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empress Dowager: Stay fit, don&amp;rsquo;t give me any of that fancy stuff.

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No direct path connects Cining Gong to the Six Western Palaces; we detoured past Yangxin Dian (Hall of Mental Cultivation), which was closed for renovation. We did see the Grand Council (Junjichu) in front. Kangxi, a dedicated scholar, established Nan Shufang (South Study) near Yangxin Dian to discuss military affairs, rituals, calligraphy, painting, literature, and even mathematics. During Yongzheng&amp;rsquo;s reign, the emperor moved to Yangxin Dian and established the Grand Council, diminishing Nan Shufang&amp;rsquo;s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kangxi: You can&amp;rsquo;t even begin to imagine the life of a top student.

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t thoroughly explore the Inner Court&amp;rsquo;s Outer Western Road and the Six Western Palaces due to closing time and our aching feet. Over 60,000 steps in two days is astronomical for two homebodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3-prince-gongs-mansion-temple-of-confucius-and-imperial-college"&gt;Day 3: Prince Gong&amp;rsquo;s Mansion, Temple of Confucius, and Imperial College
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prince Gong&amp;rsquo;s Mansion is significant. Guides and apps claim it witnessed the Qing Dynasty&amp;rsquo;s rise and fall—half its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="residential-area"&gt;Residential Area
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former prince&amp;rsquo;s residence, it was built to a lower standard than the imperial palace. It uses green glazed tiles, but the courtyard layout mirrors the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s central axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-22-53-49.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yin&amp;rsquo;an Hall, at the center, is less grand than palace buildings, but its name is significant. A prince&amp;rsquo;s main hall usually wasn&amp;rsquo;t named, just called &amp;ldquo;main hall.&amp;rdquo; So, genuine mansions typically lack plaques. Yin&amp;rsquo;an Hall, also called Yinluan Hall, rivals the Hall of Supreme Harmony (Jinluan Hall), reflecting Prince Gong Yixin&amp;rsquo;s peak power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-22-54-10.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Front of Yin&amp;rsquo;an Hall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was crowded, so I photographed it from the side, revealing Yin&amp;rsquo;an Hall&amp;rsquo;s architectural style and delicate gable decoration. Regulations allowed princes&amp;rsquo; residences green glazed tiles and hip-and-gable roofs for main gates, halls, and sleeping halls. Officials were restricted to gray-black tiles and couldn&amp;rsquo;t use hip-and-gable roofs. Thus, Heshen, regardless of his power, couldn&amp;rsquo;t use this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-22-54-35.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;West gable wall of Yin&amp;rsquo;an Hall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yin&amp;rsquo;an Hall, destroyed by fire in the early Republic, was rebuilt in 2008, making it quite new. Liang Sicheng aided its restoration. The repair team initially only had a floor plan, lacking details, until they found Liang&amp;rsquo;s detailed records. He&amp;rsquo;d documented the mansion while participating in renovations when it served as Fu Jen Catholic University&amp;rsquo;s campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The residential area has three sections: east, middle, and west. In Heshen&amp;rsquo;s time, the middle section was the main hall, used for major events. The east housed Princess Gurun Hexiao, Heshen&amp;rsquo;s daughter-in-law, favored by Emperor Qianlong, who married her to Heshen&amp;rsquo;s son, Fengshen Yinde. The west was Heshen&amp;rsquo;s residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North of the west section is Xijinzhai. During Prince Gong Yixin&amp;rsquo;s time, it held Lu Ji&amp;rsquo;s famous Jin Dynasty calligraphy, &amp;ldquo;Pingfu Tie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/Ping_Fu_Tie_by_Lu_Ji.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pingfu Tie,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m no calligraphy expert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Xi&amp;rdquo; in Xijinzhai derives from &amp;ldquo;Ci,&amp;rdquo; meaning bestowed treasures. &amp;ldquo;Jin&amp;rdquo; refers to the Jin Dynasty masterpiece. The west side hall, Er&amp;rsquo;erzhai, implies that compared to &amp;ldquo;Pingfu Tie,&amp;rdquo; these buildings and treasures are insignificant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yixin: My precious!

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xijinzhai, though remote, is the mansion&amp;rsquo;s most luxurious building. Heshen called it Jialetang. Its exterior is plain, but the interior is stunning. Heshen used designs exceeding his rank, making his residence grander than Princess Gurun Hexiao&amp;rsquo;s. For instance, golden nanmu pillars, reserved for the emperor, became a major crime during his house raid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long, two-story building, Houzhao Building, separates the residence and garden. Houzhao rooms are at the back of traditional siheyuan courtyards, serving as houses and the back wall. A multi-story Houzhao room is a Houzhao Building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret of this Houzhao Building is on its north side. From the garden, each second-floor window has unique shapes and carvings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/VID_20190914_121349.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Heshen&amp;rsquo;s personal indexing system. Shapes represented treasure types. Walking under the eaves, he&amp;rsquo;d know what was hidden behind each room by the window. He reportedly often strolled there with a cryptic smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heshen: My precious! × N

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qianlong tolerated Heshen&amp;rsquo;s greed because he saw him as capable and loyal. Compared to ambitious past ministers, greed seemed minor. Heshen, a miser who hoarded wealth, served as Qianlong&amp;rsquo;s piggy bank. Jiaqing broke it open immediately after Qianlong&amp;rsquo;s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="garden-area"&gt;Garden Area
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three paths lead from the residence to the garden. The middle one goes through the Western Gate, built during Prince Gong Yixin&amp;rsquo;s time. It&amp;rsquo;s said to be one of only three Western-style gates in Beijing then, and the garden&amp;rsquo;s only Western-style structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden&amp;rsquo;s theme is fortune (福, fu). A bat pond lies at the Western Gate&amp;rsquo;s entrance, a bat hall at the northern end, and bat patterns adorn many buildings. The garden also holds a stele with Kangxi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;fu&amp;rdquo; character, written for Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang and later given to Heshen by Qianlong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden&amp;rsquo;s lake and bat pond connect to Shichahai, a privilege reserved for princes. Ministers&amp;rsquo; ponds couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect externally. East of the bat pond is Qinqiu Pavilion, built by Yixin for his favorite concubine. Its floor has a winding channel for a &amp;ldquo;floating cup&amp;rdquo; game, a Liubei Pavilion. It was my first time seeing a real &amp;ldquo;Qu Shui Liu Shang.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-02-49.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden&amp;rsquo;s theater is unique, being China&amp;rsquo;s only fully indoor one. Its beams and pillars are painted with wisteria, appearing somewhat odd now. Yixin prepared it for Cixi, who always watched operas outdoors. He mimicked the outdoor setting inside to cater to her habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-03-16.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South of the lake, on the west side, is Miaoxiang Pavilion, oddly shaped. After Prince Gong helped Cixi gain power, she sidelined him. He built this pavilion, resembling her ceremonial hat, to vent his anger, occasionally stepping on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-03-35.jpg"

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cixi: Why the sudden headaches?

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the southwest corner is a small mountain god temple, worshipping hedgehogs, weasels, foxes, and snakes—common animals then revered as gods. Nearby is a small Dragon King temple. Heshen, advised by a feng shui master that this spot was the garden&amp;rsquo;s water level and dragon&amp;rsquo;s location, built it for worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="temple-of-confucius"&gt;Temple of Confucius
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We left Prince Gong&amp;rsquo;s Mansion for the Temple of Confucius and the Imperial College, adjacent attractions with a single ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I examined the door studs of Dacheng Gate at the Temple of Confucius. Originally for fixing, preventing wood warping, they became linked to status in the Qing Dynasty. Their shape and number were restricted; commoners couldn&amp;rsquo;t use them freely. Odd numbers are yang, even numbers yin. Nine, the largest yang number, represents imperial authority (e.g., Nine-Five Supremacy, Nine-Dragon Wall). Doors directly linked to the emperor used 9 rows and 9 columns of studs (81 total).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at my Forbidden City photos, a missing stud (lower left) shows they penetrate the door panel. This photo shows Xihe Gate, leading to Wuying Hall. Though a side gate, it maintains the highest standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-05-38.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xihe Gate of the Forbidden City, 81 door studs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dacheng Gate&amp;rsquo;s studs are identical. Dacheng Hall also reflects the highest architectural standards. The Temple of Confucius&amp;rsquo;s last major Qing renovation was during the Guangxu period, demonstrating the regime&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of Confucian culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-04-06.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The grandeur of Dacheng Hall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dacheng Hall displays musical instruments like chime bells and stones. Confucianism emphasizes rituals and music, often mentioned together as &amp;ldquo;Li Beng Yue Huai&amp;rdquo; (collapse of rituals and music). Though often considered a whole, they are literally two distinct, yet inseparable, concepts in Confucianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-06-32.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This set of bronze chime bells is remarkably well-preserved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chime stones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="imperial-college"&gt;Imperial College
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjacent Imperial College, the highest Ming and Qing Dynasty institution of learning, predates the Forbidden City, having been built in the Yuan Dynasty. The glazed archway behind Taixue Gate, China&amp;rsquo;s only archway dedicated to education, is impressive. Its four pillars represent merit, fame, profit, and wealth. The building features lotus nail carvings, symbolizing &amp;ldquo;success in successive examinations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-08-29.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glazed archway, excluding the side pillars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piyong Hall, at the Imperial College&amp;rsquo;s center, is the world&amp;rsquo;s only building dedicated to imperial lectures. After Emperor Qianlong, each new emperor lectured here, emphasizing education.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About to enter Piyong, I was sidetracked by an interesting exhibition on the imperial examination system&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-imperial-examination-system"&gt;The Imperial Examination System
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ancient talent selection system evolved. &amp;ldquo;Ju Xiaolian,&amp;rdquo; often heard in ancient texts, was an assessment in the Han Dynasty&amp;rsquo;s inspection system. Compared to other systems, the imperial examination better promoted social mobility, a significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-10-34.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Han Dynasty, special carriages fetched candidates for capital positions. This reminded me of &amp;ldquo;Gongche Shangshu&amp;rdquo; (Petition by Scholars), realizing &amp;ldquo;Gongche&amp;rdquo; refers to that group of intellectuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-10-50.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tang Dynasty saw the imperial examination develop, with subdivisions for literature, science, medicine, and martial arts. It even accepted foreigners as officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-11-46.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Song Dynasty pioneered the palace examination and had a relatively complete anti-cheating system. Candidates&amp;rsquo; papers were rewritten, and names sealed before being given to examiners, preventing favoritism. Examiners graded papers on a five-level scale: excellent, good, medium, poor, and inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-11-19.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, only the Jinshi remained. As the system matured, social mobility slowed. Early Qing saw a higher proportion of officials&amp;rsquo; children passing the Jinshi exam than commoners. Kangxi introduced separate papers, with quotas for officials and commoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only knew of the provincial, metropolitan, and palace examinations. But commoners actually faced six stages: child, provincial, metropolitan, palace, court, and Shuguan examinations. The child examination was a qualification. The provincial examination was held in the province, supervised by central officials. Those who passed were Juren; the top scorer was Jieyuan. The metropolitan examination was in Beijing, at the Gongyuan outside the Forbidden City. The top scorer was Huiyuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The palace examination tested culture and calligraphy. The Guangge style, a neat small regular script, was used. During a Qianlong-era palace examination, Liu Fenggao kept writing until dark, refusing to hand in his paper. The Minister of Rites, seeing his excellent calligraphy, ordered candles for him. He placed third. Qianlong, finding Liu short and unattractive, tested him with a couplet: &amp;ldquo;East Qiming, West Chang庚, South Ji North Dou, I am the star-picking hand.&amp;rdquo; Liu instantly replied: &amp;ldquo;Spring peony, summer peony, autumn chrysanthemum, winter plum, I am the Tanhualang.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-21-00-16-27.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He looks quite normal in the portrait!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides culture and calligraphy, names could change fates. During a Jiajing-era palace examination, two top candidates were Qin Minglei and Wu Qing. Wu Qing was stronger, but Jiajing disliked the name. During a drought, Minglei (sounding like thunder, implying rain) was favored, making him Zhuangyuan. Wu Qing placed third. A limerick satirized this: &amp;ldquo;Wuqing (heartless) candidate, heartless emperor, Minglei picked up the bargain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only three placed in the top three of the palace examination; the numbers for second and third ranks varied. Different levels had different career prospects. Stopping at the palace examination often meant local assignment, hindering promotion. To get closer to the center, most Jinshi took the Hanlin Academy examination, a graduate school. 90% of Ming Dynasty Grand Secretaries came from the Hanlin Academy, a career fast track. The entrance exam was the court examination. Admitted Jinshi were Shujishi; the top three were exempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hanlin Academy&amp;rsquo;s graduation examination was the Shuguan examination. It divided Shujishi into three groups. The first stayed, doing compilation and potentially teaching princes, with fast promotion. Some of the second stayed, others went to the six ministries. The third group returned to the official circle, awaiting employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-12-56.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imperial examination paper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the exhibition, it was too late to explore the Imperial College further. The day&amp;rsquo;s itinerary concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4-summer-palace"&gt;Day 4: Summer Palace
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Summer Palace is more relaxed than the previous days. The historical events here aren&amp;rsquo;t as dense as at the Forbidden City and Prince Gong&amp;rsquo;s Mansion; it&amp;rsquo;s primarily for sightseeing. A perfect, relaxing end to the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a sense of familiarity arriving at the Summer Palace. Tourists from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, like myself, feel right at home. Qianlong, with his Jiangnan obsession, didn&amp;rsquo;t find six trips to Jiangnan enough. He recreated it at the Summer Palace (then Qingyi Garden). Suzhou Street mimics a Jiangnan water town, Xiequ Garden replicates a Jiangnan garden, and Kunming Lake is a stand-in for Hangzhou&amp;rsquo;s West Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cixi adored Suzhou Street. She&amp;rsquo;d have palace maids and eunuchs play the roles of residents, merchants, and tourists, simulating a real water town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palace maids &amp;amp; eunuchs: The Truman Show, take 76, everyone ready, Action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="longevity-hill"&gt;Longevity Hill
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I entered from the North Palace Gate, behind Longevity Hill. Passing Suzhou Street, you&amp;rsquo;re at the mountain&amp;rsquo;s peak: the Four Great Regions, a Tibetan Buddhist structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-14-09.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking up at the Four Great Regions from the north side&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unimpressive from the back. But circling to Kunming Lake&amp;rsquo;s front and re-climbing Longevity Hill, the building&amp;rsquo;s grandeur emerges. While not as grand as the Forbidden City, it rises with the mountain, creating a natural solemnity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paiyun Hall, where Cixi celebrated her birthdays, sits at the mountain&amp;rsquo;s foot. Emperor Guangxu had to wait in a side hall. Most Qing rulers followed Tibetan Buddhism. Dehui Hall, behind Paiyun Hall, bridges secular and religious authority. Beyond it lies the Buddhist realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking up at Dehui Hall and Foxiang Pavilion from Paiyun Hall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps are narrow, cramped. Looking up at Foxiang Pavilion from them is striking – the size contrast is dramatic. Turning, you get a panoramic view of Kunming Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ascending, you see the repeating Buddha statues in Zhongxiangjie and Zhihuihai – a powerful visual. The lower statues&amp;rsquo; heads were looted by the Eight-Nation Alliance; the current ones are restorations, hence their new appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buddha statues on the wall of Zhihuihai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Four Great Regions, blending imperial and Tibetan Buddhist styles, crowns the peak. Climbing from the front, it evokes the Potala Palace. For a moment, I felt transported to Lhasa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descending east, I reached Kunming Lake. Looking back at Longevity Hill, the climb is clearly visible, undeniably solemn and majestic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hall-of-benevolence-and-longevity-renshoudian-and-grand-theater-deheyuan"&gt;Hall of Benevolence and Longevity (RenShouDian) and Grand Theater (DeHeYuan)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the Forbidden City, the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity impressed me most. Cixi, during her regency, favored the Summer Palace. This hall, like the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s Hall of Supreme Harmony, hosted ceremonies and foreign envoys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-20-59.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two dragons and two phoenixes flank a bronze &lt;em&gt;qilin&lt;/em&gt;. Unusually, the phoenixes are central, a testament to Cixi&amp;rsquo;s power. The area lacks the Hall of Supreme Harmony&amp;rsquo;s masculine energy (with its bronze lions), but pines, stones, and bronze &lt;em&gt;ding&lt;/em&gt; vessels lend it an air of elder statesmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elder Statesman: No dog head? Seriously?

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cixi loved opera. My wife says she&amp;rsquo;d be a homebody today, binge-watching shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North of the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity is the Deheyuan Grand Theater. It blows the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s Hall of Changyinge (Sound of Smooth Music) out of the water. Similar style, but vastly upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-22-32.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grand Theater of Deheyuan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A corner of the Grand Theater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cixi didn&amp;rsquo;t just watch; she made officials join. The Hall of Yile (YiLeDian), opposite Deheyuan, was her viewing platform; the side corridors were for officials. Cixi saw it as a treat, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t. With no restrooms, officials needing relief had to bribe eunuchs to open a gate, escape via ladder, and follow a small path to the toilet – the &amp;ldquo;Happy Little Path.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-30-03.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The side corridors served as officials&amp;rsquo; boxes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official: I&amp;rsquo;m sneaking out. If the Old Buddha calls, say I&amp;rsquo;m here.

&lt;p&gt;Deheyuan has three courtyards. Behind the Hall of Yile is another, used for resting during intermissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="garden-of-harmonious-interests-xiequyuan"&gt;Garden of Harmonious Interests (XieQuYuan)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Summer Palace is vast. Coming from Hangzhou, I skipped Kunming Lake&amp;rsquo;s large expanse. But I discovered a hidden gem: the Garden of Harmonious Interests, in the northeast corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a delicate Jiangnan-style garden, a garden within a garden. The architecture, with single-eave, roll-shed, and hip-and-gable roofs, is imperial. This blend of elegance and imperial grandeur is rare in Jiangnan, and truly striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Knowing-Fish Bridge (ZhiYuQiao) is the highlight. It&amp;rsquo;s low, ideal for fish-watching. Qianlong named it after Zhuangzi and Huizi&amp;rsquo;s philosophical &amp;ldquo;debate&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not a fish; how do you know their joy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qianlong: I just know, alright? Keep it up!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pond corner, viewed from the Knowing-Fish Bridge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="beautiful-corners"&gt;Beautiful Corners
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these, the Summer Palace has secluded, beautiful corners, rarely seen by tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East of Longevity Hill is the Multi-Treasure Glazed Pagoda (DuoBaoLiuLiTa). Its surface, covered in Buddha statues, echoes Longevity Hill&amp;rsquo;s Hall of the Sea of Wisdom (ZhiHuiHai). Though closed, you can walk around it, getting quite close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-32-57.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northeast of the pagoda is the isolated Hall of Tanning (DanNingTang). The Summer Palace&amp;rsquo;s Rear Lake, more a narrow river, lies north of it. The view south from the north bank offers a unique, tranquil beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-33-27.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;A nearby bridge is also distinctive, perfect for photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as evening approached, the sky filled with cirrus and cirrocumulus clouds – stunning weather!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="beijing-impressions"&gt;Beijing Impressions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="accommodation"&gt;Accommodation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stayed in Beijing for four days and five nights. The first three nights were at an Airbnb near Zhangzizhong Road, close to Nanluoguxiang. The room was tiny but cozy, clean, and well-connected. Finding a gem like that takes luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/20190921_003617.gif"
loading="lazy"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-21-00-49-11.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could even glimpse a &lt;em&gt;siheyuan&lt;/em&gt; (courtyard house) from the window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two nights were a total bust. Another Airbnb, but it was a bait-and-switch – nothing like the pictures. Dirty and awful. The location was also off, not where it was pinned on the map, and you needed a taxi to reach the subway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two takeaways about lodging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize location near transit. In cities with solid subway systems, rely on public transport. No need to switch places mid-trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Rent is market-driven; don&amp;rsquo;t get your hopes up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="food"&gt;Food
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mostly ate lunch at the sights, grabbing bread to save time. I only got to sample local food in the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first night&amp;rsquo;s dinner sticks with me. After exiting the Forbidden City&amp;rsquo;s Shenwu Gate, I went west around Jingshan Park, then north into Gongjian Hutong. Deep in the hutong, there&amp;rsquo;s a restaurant in an old imperial ice cellar. The original ice storage is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-36-25.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-36-37.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice was a royal commodity in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Each winter, ice cutters harvested blocks from lakes, hauling them to ice cellars across Beijing. The Ministry of Works oversaw it. Ice cutting was brutal, backbreaking work. It was hereditary; no quitting. The 1.5 &lt;em&gt;chi&lt;/em&gt; square blocks fit perfectly into ice chests. Stored for half a year, the ice came out for summer use. It was even a prestigious gift, &amp;ldquo;awarding ice&amp;rdquo; to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice (bing) is a loaded word, sounding like &amp;ldquo;soldier&amp;rdquo; in Chinese. This partially explains the emperor&amp;rsquo;s monopoly. When Zhu Di plotted to overthrow Emperor Jianwen, he consulted the monk Yao Guangxiao (Dao Yan). Zhu Di, instead of stating his intentions directly, offered the first line of a couplet: &amp;ldquo;When the sky is cold and the earth is frozen, water without a single dot cannot become ice (bing).&amp;rdquo; Yao Guangxiao, catching his drift, replied: &amp;ldquo;When the country is in chaos and the people are worried, who will be the leader if the king (wang) does not step forward?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding local specialties, Peking duck and copper charcoal hot pot are decent. But you can find them everywhere now, just as authentic, so I skipped them. I had dinner with classmates twice – one Western, one Xinjiang. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get into the traditional Beijing snacks: &lt;em&gt;baodu&lt;/em&gt; (boiled tripe), &lt;em&gt;luzhu&lt;/em&gt; (stewed pork offal), &lt;em&gt;chaogan&lt;/em&gt; (stir-fried liver)&amp;hellip; Beijing cuisine features a lot of offal. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan, and to me, these dishes don&amp;rsquo;t quite mask the gamey flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-36-50.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicken broth radish, &lt;em&gt;baodu&lt;/em&gt;, and sesame sauce for &lt;em&gt;baodu&lt;/em&gt; at the Imperial Ice Cellar Restaurant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-37-09.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yaoji Chaogan at the foot of the Drum Tower, from top left to
bottom right: almond tofu, &lt;em&gt;luzhu&lt;/em&gt;, garlic vinegar sauce for &lt;em&gt;luzhu&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;zhajiangmian&lt;/em&gt; (noodles with savory soybean paste), &lt;em&gt;chaogan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some digging, and many claim Beijingers were poor in the late Qing Dynasty, resorting to scraps. I think it&amp;rsquo;s plausible the other way around – people actively &lt;em&gt;chose&lt;/em&gt; these ingredients. Offal was cheap in Beijing, dirt cheap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the well-off princes and nobles, Beijing&amp;rsquo;s daily livestock consumption was staggering. The meat was used, ice cellars were royal-only, and offal, hard to preserve or transport, flooded the market. Offal prices were likely much lower than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also suspect that, due to royal protocol, meat demand in Beijing during the Ming and Qing was more rigid. Even as the economy declined, meat consumption likely stayed high. So, as the late Qing economy worsened, offal became even cheaper, establishing it as a regional specialty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an article with a similar viewpoint, though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t focus solely on Beijing&amp;rsquo;s offal consumption: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.douban.com/note/666792033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.douban.com/note/666792033/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;douzhi&amp;rsquo;er&lt;/em&gt; (fermented mung bean milk). I got a cup near Prince Gong&amp;rsquo;s Mansion. It&amp;rsquo;s made from fermented mung beans, which are mostly sugar and protein. The fermented taste is&amp;hellip;unique. The shop owner was funny. He poured a tiny disposable cup. My wife asked, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s it?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Finish it, and I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a refill.&amp;rdquo; She took one sip, tossed it, and said it reeked of rotten eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owner: Hey! Leaving so soon? No refill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides traditional snacks, I found a killer dessert shop in Jianchang Hutong near Guozijian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="anecdotes"&gt;Anecdotes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember arriving in Beijing; hailing a taxi at the station was impossible. I took a shuttle bus further out to grab one. The driver&amp;rsquo;s Beijing accent was a real pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-42-52.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take the shuttle bus one stop, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get a cab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was like that the whole trip. Ride-hailing drivers everywhere have their groups, chatting on voice messages at red lights. Beijing drivers have a totally different style. The whole group was hyping up a driver who&amp;rsquo;d hit his daily bonus and was calling it quits – like a &lt;em&gt;xiangsheng&lt;/em&gt; (crosstalk) routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Damn! You&amp;rsquo;re killing it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Missed one fare, I&amp;rsquo;m toast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a light, I saw something heartwarming. An old man pedaled a canopied tricycle across the road. It was uphill; he was struggling. His wife, presumably, sat in the back. She stretched out her legs, helping him pedal. Once they crested the hill, she sat back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of&amp;hellip; interacting forces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my last night, my classmate treated me to Xinjiang food. The main dish was a huge plate of &lt;em&gt;jiaomaji&lt;/em&gt; (chicken with numbing peppers) – a massive portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-43-43.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmate said it&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to Northeastern cuisine. She&amp;rsquo;d been there on business: &amp;ldquo;The &lt;em&gt;guobaorou&lt;/em&gt; (sweet and sour pork) is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; big,&amp;rdquo; she said, gesturing. For something refined, she goes for Japanese. Japanese food in Northeast China is localized – still sushi, hand rolls, sashimi, but double the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind blown! Big eaters who love Japanese food, head to Northeast China – you&amp;rsquo;ll be stuffed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmate lives in Xizhimen, supposedly the &amp;ldquo;center of the universe&amp;rdquo; (laughs). I also visited Sanlitun, and compared to that, Xizhimen feels older, not so &amp;ldquo;center of the universe.&amp;rdquo; The key is the prestigious schools and diverse population, supporting a varied commercial scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-46-04.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Near Xizhimen Subway Station&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmate broke it down: different times for students hanging out, European and American students emerging, bar-hopping crowds, and often, drunk Japanese and Koreans on the streets. And after that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking, the capital&amp;rsquo;s nightlife is so sophisticated, what could be next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it&amp;rsquo;s the IT worker exodus. The line of overtime slaves for the subway stretches from inside the station to the intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Hangzhou, I knew I&amp;rsquo;d return to Beijing. Its historical sites, hutongs, nature, museums, and exhibitions are endless; you&amp;rsquo;ll always discover something new. I was too ambitious this time, a bit rushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realized I don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate my own city enough. I&amp;rsquo;ve become complacent. I need to shift my perspective and revisit Hangzhou as a tourist, to truly understand my home.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>北京4天5夜</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3580/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 18:03:29 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3580/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-20-16.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 北京4天5夜" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;这是篇万字长文游记，没耐心看的话，刷刷图片也挺好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第3回来北京。第一回还太小，什么也不懂。第二回没看古迹，直奔了军事博物馆。这回才真正认识了这座城市，印象深刻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;出发之前，想到家里的小强们正躲在各种夹缝角落里摩拳擦掌，密谋好了等我一走就出来蹦迪，连蹦5天。我就默默打开了火车票订单，手指悬停在退票按钮上，邪魅一笑傲视四方。一时间屋里各种哀嚎，抱头痛哭，触角齐刷刷立起来：“别别别！”、“住手——”、“Oh s**t!”……其中有个暴脾气，直接来了个前空翻，把正在啃的饼干屑一劈为二。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好了，戏精部分结束，我还是出发了，让它们蹦去吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下班拖着行李直奔高铁站，当晚就到北京。杭州到北京居然只有4个半小时，有点小吃惊。行程总共4天5夜，中秋期间，温度和天气都非常舒适，白天没有下雨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;永乐帝迁都北京前，对整个北京城做了一番规划。整个北京以紫禁城为核心分为4层：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;最里层是宫城，也叫紫禁城，就是今天的故宫博物院。南起午门、北至神武门。紫禁城的这个“紫”，就是紫薇星，我们今天叫北极星。由于它在天球中固定不动，其他星星绕它旋转，所以代表天下之主的帝王。紫禁城的“禁”，戒备森严，平民不得入内。依明清律法，平民擅闯皇城者，杖一百，流放三千里。平民擅闯宫城者，绞死。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;宫城外面一层是皇城，南起天安门、北至地安门。皇城住着绝大多数为皇帝生活起居提供服务的人员。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;再往外是内城，范围大概就是今天的北京地铁2号线，这就是为什么2号线绝大部分站名都是门。这里才是百姓允许居住的范围，王府、相府也只能到此为止。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;然后就是外城了。起初外城只是南侧的一小片，随着城市发展范围才逐渐扩大。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;北京城的规划中，有一条中轴线贯穿这4层结构。紫禁城，甚至太和殿上的龙椅，也是不偏不倚落在这中轴线上，讲究的是一个“正”。从今天的地图上也能看出来，现代北京横平竖直的路网，也是永乐帝留下的余威。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="故宫的门"&gt;故宫的门
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-20-38-54.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;故宫博物院的入口在天安门。往里依次经过端门、午门，才算真正进入紫禁城。天安门往外还有两座门，大清门和正阳门。大清门在明朝时叫大明门，是国门。今天已经不存在了，建设天安门广场时被拆除。正阳门也就是今天的前门，主要起军事防御作用。曾经还配有瓮城和箭楼，如今只剩城楼和箭楼，瓮城在民国时期被拆除。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;天安门内外侧华表上各有一对石犼。内侧的叫做望君出，寓意皇帝不要贪图享乐，要走出去了解百姓疾苦。外侧的叫望君归，寓意皇帝不要游山玩水，要勤勉治国。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;皇帝：你还要我怎样！要怎样！？
&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-49-56.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;端门的门洞&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;午门有5个门洞，明三暗五。因为远远看去只能看到3个，走近才发现侧面还有2个。这个和金水河上的御路桥、王公桥、品级桥一样，有森严的等级制度。中央只能皇帝出入，不过皇帝大婚时皇后进城能走一次，科举殿试一甲前三名出城能走一次。旁边两个门洞供皇亲贵胄使用。两侧的门洞过文武百官，左侧文官，右侧武将。当然这个左右，是以皇帝坐北朝南的方位而言的。东侧文华殿，西侧武英殿，整个紫禁城外朝的格局，就是按这个左文右武的思想来规划的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/VID_20190913_102951.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;午门三面有城墙&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;进到午门内，从中间门洞回望。视线越过人群头顶，可以看到端门、天安门的门洞。再往外看去是人民英雄纪念碑。如果大清门还在，应该能看到大清门和正阳门的门洞。笔直下去5道门，光是想一想，就有“普天之下莫非王土”的感觉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;午门进来再经过太和门，这又是个秀肌肉的地方。虽然只是门，却比故宫大多数建筑都宏伟。太和门曾经在光绪年间失火。恰逢光绪大婚，依礼制，皇后要走过太和门。有人出主意，找彩棚匠来搭了个纸糊的太和门。惟妙惟肖，宫人竟然分辨不出真假。太和门真正重建完成前，这个彩棚门用了6年。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-20-53-10.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;太和门前的铜狮&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="外朝区"&gt;外朝区
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;太和门与太和殿之间的广场是故宫最开阔的地方。但是一棵树都没有，这种纯人工的宏大景观，给上朝的文武百官一种心理上的压迫感。无非还是那个目的：彰显帝王威仪。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-27-08.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;太和殿是整个故宫最尊贵的建筑，2200多平米，72根整根的楠木立柱支撑。不仅仅是大而已，它的顶是古建筑中的最高级别，重檐庑殿顶。顶端一根横脊，四面曲面斜坡流水。这种庑殿顶大多数情况下也就是皇帝本人使用了。至于重檐，百姓家也是禁止的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-23-49.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;太和殿曾经4次失火，分别在明永乐、嘉靖、万历和清康熙年间。整个建筑是纯木质结构，很容易着。前2次是天雷导致，后2次受了别处失火的牵连。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其中嘉靖那次着火很好玩。重建时嘉靖和大臣们讨论原因，如何避免再失火。那时候人哪知道避雷针，想来想去觉得是名字问题。太和殿最初的名字是奉天殿，牌匾竖着写。大臣们发现，奉字压在天字头上，估计天不高兴了。于是有人建议横过来写，把天字放大，升格抬高。嘉靖皇帝就说了两个字：不雅。吃藕丑啊！于是决定改名字为皇极殿，皇字当头，竖着写就没问题了。至于改名太和殿，那是清朝的事情了。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除了改名，还采取了许多其他措施防火，但基本都是风水神鬼之道。真正起到实际作用的，就只有一项，在城中各个角落遍布水缸。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-25-57.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;御花园内的一座水缸&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;太和殿主要的作用是大型典礼。皇帝登基、大婚、亲征等等。但是由于反复失火和一些其他原因，真正在这里举行的典礼并不多。明朝14个皇帝，只有一半在太和殿登基。至于大婚，必须是少年天子，人生第一次结婚。明清两朝总共6位皇帝在太和殿举行婚礼，明正统、万历，清顺治、康熙、同治、光绪。至于亲征大典，只有康熙出征葛尔丹时举行了。明正统、正德皇帝也亲征过，不过都没走正规流程。不顾大臣反对，带着部队直接就跑了。尤其明英宗正统皇帝，土木堡之变阴沟里翻船。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;太和殿东侧有座叫体仁阁的建筑，非常幽静，没什么人往这边来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-29-49.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;康熙朝举行了博学鸿儒科考试，在太和殿举行仪式之后，考试就在这进行。这是科举制度之外的一次额外的人才选拔，全国各地推举人才来参加考试，反而有点察举制的味道。博学鸿儒考试，对考生的待遇比科举殿试好得多。有桌椅，不必坐地上；撤去了侍卫；不限考试时间，天黑还给蜡烛继续答。而且提供一顿非常豪华的晚餐，考生4人一桌，一桌的标准是400两银子。与之相比，一个知县一年俸禄大约也就60两。博学鸿儒科考试，130多名考生录取了50名，都按科举一甲前三名的标准对待。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后面的中和殿是个正方形的建筑，圆形的鎏金宝顶，反映天圆地方的世界观。殿顶在特定时候每天会反射太阳光到城东边的二郎庙。当时人们不知道原因，觉得是二郎庙这座道观有神明显灵。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中和殿作为皇帝在大型仪式前的休息室，也可以举办小型宴会、会议和典礼。明朝灭亡前，崇祯皇帝最后一次开会就在这里，十几个大臣没人敢说句有用的，都在打哈哈。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;外朝区最后面的是保和殿。这里曾经住过顺治和康熙。宫和殿的称呼有讲究，殿是处理国事的场所，宫处理家事。顺治入关后原本住乾清宫，但是乾清宫年久失修，所以修缮期间暂住保和殿。既然住人了，就得改名为宫。顺治与康熙住保和殿时期，此建筑分别叫做位育宫和清宁宫。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中和殿与保和殿，一张合适的照片也没拍到。这一带是故宫游人最密集的区域。皇帝们看文武百官山呼万岁，觉得意气风发。让他看今天的故宫游客试试？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;皇帝：护驾！！！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="内廷区"&gt;内廷区
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;乾清门是外朝三殿和内廷三宫的分界。乾清宫区域形成一个独立院落，包括乾清宫、交泰殿、坤宁宫。按建筑初衷来说，这三处分别是皇帝居所、祭祀礼仪风水场地、皇后居所。但是从内廷开始，就可以发现很多时候他们并不按这些章法来使用。雍正从乾清宫搬去养心殿住，坤宁宫被当成祭祀场所，还有偏要住西六宫的慈禧。所以去记这些用途意义倒是不大。人是活的，什么规矩都有变通之法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;乾清宫里悬挂着正大光明牌匾。从雍正朝开始，为减少皇子相争，使用过一种秘密立储的制度。皇帝在位时暗地里写好传位诏书，一式两份。一份自己存好，一份藏在牌匾后，秘而不宣。皇帝驾崩后，找出这两份诏书比对，相吻合则以此为继位依据。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-22-14-12-16.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在坤宁宫拍到一张神奇的照片，用旧时工艺烧制的玻璃，能反射出多彩的光芒。坤宁宫内部昏暗，通过玻璃看到的是天空，色彩惊人惊叹。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-31-22.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;坤宁宫门前的日晷&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;内廷三宫背后是御花园，面积并不大，比恭王府的私人花园小得多。当然，这样比不太公平。皇家的休闲场所怎么可能只有这个小花园，宫外的颐和园、圆明园等加起来，才是合理的比较对象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;御花园几处景观&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;御花园出去就是神武门，整个紫禁城的北门。每次皇家出游，女眷从神武门出，皇帝从午门出，再汇合出发。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-35-29.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;神武门之前称作玄武门。为什么和玄武门之变的那个同名？传统文化中认为四种神兽与方位有对应关系，东青龙，西白虎，南朱雀，北玄武。玄武门常用来表示北方的门。后来要避康熙的名讳玄烨，就换了个字，改为神武门。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;神武门外侧回望&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="故宫东侧"&gt;故宫东侧
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;中轴线这样就走完了。再从内廷东路往南，折返去逛东六宫。对后宫历史了解不多，现在也没记住几个宫和里面的女主人。印象比较深的是当红的延禧宫，院内有一座水殿。初看以为是火灾遗址，听了讲解才知道，这是个烂尾楼。延禧宫多次遭火灾，光绪帝的瑾妃（也有说法是隆裕太后）主持建设一座西洋水晶宫，一来镇火，二来赏鱼。建筑下方是水池，池中养各式金鱼，地面用玻璃铺路。不过由于财政紧张，工程半途中止。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-37-44.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;如果真建起来了，水下那一层也基本就和今天的海洋公园无异了&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;东六宫往南路过一座建筑叫箭亭。箭亭内部空旷，用于练习箭术、切磋武艺，是武举人考试的场所。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-39-20.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;箭亭内展出了八旗军的武器装备与战袍&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;马鞍&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;继续向南，协和门以东，个人认为是故宫最幽静的区域。文华殿建筑群躲在茂密的树林背后，这里最重要的两座建筑是文华殿与文渊阁。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-54-19.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;回望协和门&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-40-28.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;协和门东侧的林荫小道&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三大殿被烧毁后，文华殿曾经一度是皇帝临时办公的地方。三大殿修复后，此处变为太子处理朝政的场所。因此殿顶不得使用黄色琉璃瓦，要降级成绿色琉璃瓦。直到嘉靖皇帝成年亲政后，把文华殿改为自己使用，因此今天看到的还是黄色屋顶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-54-40.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文华殿也是皇帝参与经筵的场所。经筵这项活动，主要是由大学士来给皇帝讲授儒家经典，为皇帝正三观。尤其是对少年天子，张居正在这里教过少年万历，翁同龢在这里教过少年光绪。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;光绪皇帝的第一课，翁同龢教他书法，写“天下太平，正大光明”。光绪皇帝没几天就不耐烦了，翁同龢换了个法子，开始给他讲故事。用的就是前朝张居正留下的一套教材，帝鉴图说。光绪的兴趣也没维持多久，之后翁同龢让他念文章，一遍又一遍地念。光绪不配合，死活不张嘴。翁同龢批评的有点重了，光绪直接罢课。经过慈禧一番训斥，又被迫回到了课堂。光绪皇帝慢慢长大之后，就很配合教育了，也非常尊重他的老师。在许多重大决策面前，都还会询问翁同龢的意见。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;光绪：切~ 谁还不是个宝宝呢？

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文华殿东侧的传心殿，供奉着伏羲女娲神农轩辕、尧舜禹、周公孔子等精神领袖。值得一提的是，此建筑清朝才出现，证明了满清王朝对汉族文化的接纳与推崇。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;北边的文渊阁看起来非常古旧，是紫禁城的皇家图书馆。一些重要典籍曾经保存在这里，比如四库全书。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-42-08.jpg"

&lt;h2 id="第二天故宫内廷外东路与西侧"&gt;第二天：故宫内廷外东路与西侧
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="内廷外东路"&gt;内廷外东路
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;进了午门直奔皇极殿区域。这一带称为内廷外东路，是座城中之城。院落门前就是九龙壁。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-21-56-59.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;正对九龙壁的皇极门&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;院落布局整个就是一套微缩版的紫禁城中轴线。乾隆造了这个园子给自己养老，到他在位60年时，退位为太上皇。没有超过康熙在位61年的纪录，护住了自己之前立的flag。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;皇极殿里的龙椅，乾隆退休后气派丝毫不减。这是一张自带背景音乐的照片，仔细听，有没有听见《戏说乾隆》主题曲？啊，郑少秋！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今天的皇极殿院落，已经变成了故宫博物院的珍宝馆。我对文物没什么研究，但是第一眼看到这些不计成本制作出来的艺术品，立刻就挪不动脚步了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/zhenbao-yushi.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;金器8件&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;皇极殿院落背后，主要是休息娱乐的区域。印象深刻的是畅音阁，这是故宫里最大的戏楼。畅音阁有三层，乾隆在对面的阅是楼观戏。主要的表演在畅音阁二层进行，上下两层都有垂直通道连通。当需要表演从地下钻出的桥段时，演员就从一层升至二层。当需要表演从天而降时，演员就从三层降至二层。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;后院里的乐寿堂，是慈禧曾经住过的地方。这里的室内陈设风格看上去很老沉，不像内廷三宫那样血气方刚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;墙面上挂满了大臣们献上的字画，那时她已经是权力的中心。颐和园里也有一处乐寿堂，同样也是慈禧的住所。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后院的最北边，有一口水井。故宫里的井水没人敢喝。永乐帝年间，宫里的太监宫女为了打发无聊，找人作伴，有些会暗地里结为名义上的夫妻。一天，宫女和太监的亲密举动被永乐帝看见，他顿时感到一阵恶心。下令处死所有结为夫妻的宫女和太监，投入井中。没人知道故宫的井里到底曾经泡过多少具尸体。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;死于井中的一位最重要的人物，就是光绪皇帝的宠妃珍妃。慈禧给光绪皇帝操办了和隆裕皇后的大婚，但是光绪并不喜欢这位样貌与才学都比较平庸的皇后。他更喜欢性格活泼、才学过人的珍妃。珍妃能接受西洋事物，很支持光绪变法，慈禧记恨在心。八国联军入侵北京时，慈禧西逃。临走前还不忘让人把珍妃投入皇极殿后院的这口井中。于是这口井被命名为珍妃井。自此以后，光绪像是变了一个人，完全收起了锋芒，对世事漠不关心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;出了内廷外东路，又来到了神武门。爬上故宫城墙，顺着东半圈走，可以很明显看到太和殿是整个故宫最高的建筑，屋顶的制式的确高人一等。大多数低矮的建筑都是歇山顶，两侧各有一小段垂直的山墙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;东北角楼&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在墙上还拍到了非开放区的一个小院，酷似《我在故宫修文物》里的工作场所。我和老婆一致认为就是此地。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-00-26-49.jpg"

&lt;h3 id="故宫西侧"&gt;故宫西侧
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;下了城墙，经过文华殿建筑群，直接横穿太和门广场，前往武英殿。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-19-20-55-07.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;太和门广场&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;虽说紫禁城的设计思想是左文右武，但实际上武英殿更多还是文的作用。除了明清朝代更替的那一段，李自成、多尔衮先后在此处理过军政事务，武英殿大多数时候是作为皇家的出版社，书籍的编修工作在这里进行。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;武英殿建筑群南侧，有一排不起眼的建筑叫做激桶处。这是古时候消防队所在地，应对紫禁城内大大小小的火灾。没错，光绪年间就已经开始使用“消防队”这一称呼了。当时的消防队使用一种带有活塞的管状装置，叫做激桶。这玩意的原理就像医院针筒，把水抽进来，再推出去，能喷出至少几米的水龙。武英殿的消防队，是最早出现的专职于消防工作的组织，是现代消防队的前身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2007070700202.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;激桶&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;出武英殿，绕道三大殿区域前往慈宁宫建筑群。这主要是太后和太妃居住的院落，比嫔妃们的院落宽敞气派很多。太后们大都信佛，在慈宁宫的背后有一座佛堂。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/VID_20190912_162505.gif"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;慈宁宫第二进院落，西侧建筑&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;慈宁门南侧还带有独立花园，这个花园形状狭长，不比御花园小多少。但是少了精致和灵动，看上去规规矩矩，略显单调。没有园林的感觉，就像是个老头老太太撞树的公园。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;慈宁宫没有路直通西六宫，要从外侧养心殿绕过去。养心殿在维修中暂停开放，倒是看见了养心殿前的军机处。话说康熙真是位好学的皇帝，他曾经在乾清宫院内的西南侧设立南书房，距离养心殿很近。这里是满足他求知欲的地方，为此设置了一些特殊职务在南书房工作，专职与康熙切磋军政、礼教、书画、文学，甚至数学。到了雍正朝，皇帝改住养心殿，还设立了军机处，南书房的作用被削弱了不少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;内廷外西路和西六宫区域没有太仔细逛，临近闭馆了，脚底板也疼。两天总共暴走6万多步，对于两个死宅，这基本上是天文数字了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第三天恭王府孔庙与国子监"&gt;第三天：恭王府、孔庙与国子监
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;恭王府是个不得了的地方啊，无论是景区介绍、旅行团导游、导游App，都要讲这么一句：恭王府见证了大清从鼎盛到衰落，一座恭王府，半部清代史。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="恭王府府邸区"&gt;恭王府府邸区
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;作为曾经的亲王和郡王府，建筑只能按低于皇宫的规格来设计。虽然用的是绿琉璃瓦顶，但院落结构，基本也是按照紫禁城中轴线来设计的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-22-53-49.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尤其是正中的银安殿，建筑本身无法与故宫建筑相比，但这个名字可不一般。王府里的主殿通常是不会有名字的，就叫正殿。所以真实的王府建筑通常没有牌匾。银安殿是坊间流传的名称，也有叫银銮殿的，这是要与太和殿（也叫金銮殿）相提并论啊。足见恭亲王奕䜣巅峰时期的权势地位。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-22-54-10.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;银安殿正面&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;正面人山人海，从侧面拍了一张。可以更明显辨别银安殿的建筑形制，山墙上的山花非常精致。依照工部的规定，亲王和郡王的府邸，正门、主殿、寝殿允许使用绿琉璃瓦，歇山式顶。而官员的府邸只能使用灰黑色瓦，不得使用歇山顶。所以无论和珅当时如何权倾朝野，这建筑，他指定是用不起的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-22-54-35.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;银安殿西侧山墙&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;银安殿在民国初年失火被毁，2008年才修复完成重新开放，所以现在看到的银安殿建筑非常新。银安殿和整个恭王府的复原工作还得益于梁思成。当年决定修缮恭王府时，能找到的资料只有一张平面图，缺失了大量细节。有人找出了梁思成的一份资料，非常详尽记载了恭王府内的各处建筑细节。原来恭王府作为辅仁大学校舍期间，梁思成应邀参与校舍的改造工程，对恭王府做了详细的测量与记录。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;府邸区分东中西3路：在和珅时代，中路是重大活动才启用的主殿。东路是固伦和孝公主的府邸，乾隆宠信和珅，把自己疼爱的固伦和孝公主下嫁和珅之子丰绅殷德。西路则是和珅的府邸。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;西路的北侧，有座叫锡晋斋的建筑。恭亲王奕䜣的时代，这里曾经存放着晋代陆机的书法名作《平复帖》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/Ping_Fu_Tie_by_Lu_Ji.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;平复帖，书法我真是一窍不通&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;锡晋斋的“锡”，由“赐”变化而来，御赐的珍宝。锡晋斋的“晋”，指的便是这幅晋代名作。锡晋斋西边的偏殿叫做尔尓斋，说的就是，与《平复帖》相比，这些建筑和珍宝都不过尔尔啊！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;奕䜣：My precious!
&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/precious.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;锡晋斋虽然位置偏僻，却是整个恭王府里最豪华的建筑。和珅时代，这里称作嘉乐堂。建筑外侧看去平淡无奇，里面却别有洞天。和珅用了大量逾制的设计，一个臣子的府邸，比固伦和孝公主的还豪华。比如立柱用的竟然是金丝楠木，这是只有皇帝能使用的材料。被抄家时，这也成为他一大罪状。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;府邸区的北侧，一座极长的二层楼建筑横在当中，把府邸与花园隔开，这是后罩楼。后罩房是传统四合院建筑中，最后一进院落里垫后的建筑，既是房屋，也同时是整个四合院的后院墙。后罩房如果超过一层，就称为后罩楼。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;恭王府后罩楼的玄机在北侧，花园往南看过来，二楼每一扇窗户形状、雕花都不相同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/VID_20190914_121349.gif"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是和珅自己才懂的一套索引系统，不同形状代表不同类型的珍宝。他从檐下走过，看到窗户造型，就知道那一间背后藏着什么宝贝。相传和珅常常在这檐下走过，嘴角挂着迷之微笑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;和珅如此贪财，乾隆放任不管也是有原因的。在乾隆看来，和珅有能力，肯为国效力。相比历朝历代有野心的权臣，贪财而已，不算什么问题。何况和珅是个只进不出的守财奴，很适合作为乾隆的储蓄罐。这不，乾隆一死，嘉庆就迫不及待摔罐取款了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="恭王府花园区"&gt;恭王府花园区
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;从府邸区进入花园有三条路，中间的路会经过西洋门。这座门建于恭亲王奕䜣时代，据传是当时北京仅有的三座西洋门之一，也是园里唯一的西洋建筑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整个花园区，有一个共同的主题，福。可以说这是一座以福文化为主题的园林。西洋门入口有蝠池，最北端有蝠厅，建筑多装饰有蝙蝠图案。园内还藏有康熙写给孝庄皇太后的福字碑，后被乾隆赏赐给和珅。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;恭王府花园里的湖和蝠池，都是引了什刹海的活水。这也是亲王才能享受的待遇。大臣的府邸池塘，不能与外界连通。在蝠池的东侧，有座特别的小亭子，叫沁秋亭，这是奕䜣为宠妃沁秋所建。亭中地面不是平地，而是有一套曲水流觞装置，叫做流杯亭。头一回亲眼见到曲水流觞啊。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-02-49.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;花园里的戏楼是恭王府一绝，是国内唯一一座全室内的戏楼。这座戏楼的梁柱上画满了藤萝，以今天的审美看有点奇葩。但这是恭亲王奕䜣专为慈禧准备的。慈禧向来在户外看戏。为了迎合慈禧的习惯，奕䜣在戏楼内仿造出了户外的样子，被问起时也好有个交代。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-03-16.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;花园西侧，湖的南面，有座造型古怪的建筑，叫做妙香亭。恭亲王帮助慈禧垂帘听政后，慈禧忌惮恭亲王手握重权。于是过河拆桥，把恭亲王削职回家。吃了这个哑巴亏，恭亲王便在园内建了这座酷似慈禧礼帽的亭子，没事就去踩它一踩，以此泄愤。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-03-35.jpg"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;花园西南角，有座非常袖珍的山神庙。供奉的其实是刺猬、黄鼠狼、狐狸、蛇，这是当时府中经常出现的几种动物，被当做神明来祭拜。山神庙不远处还有座龙王庙，同样非常小巧。和珅建府邸时，请风水先生算出了此处是花园中的水位，是龙之所在，便建了这座小庙来供奉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="孔庙"&gt;孔庙
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;离开恭王府，前往孔庙与国子监。后两者仅一墙之隔，是同一个景点，一张门票可通行。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在孔庙前观察了大成门的门钉。门钉原本起固定作用，防止木材膨胀翘曲。想象一下今天打衣柜用的多层板。清朝开始，门钉与社会地位挂钩。于是门钉的形制、数量都有约束，百姓不能随便使用了。在中国传统文化中，奇数是阳数，偶数是阴数。九又是阳数中最大的，常用于表示皇权威仪。比如九五之尊、九龙壁，宇宙中最客观的数学都被赋予了人文意义。与皇帝直接相关的门，就要使用横九路纵九路共81颗门钉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;翻出前一天在故宫拍的照片，从左下缺掉的那颗就能看到，门钉穿透整扇门板。故宫这张照片中是熙和门，通往武英殿。虽是前朝三大殿区的一座侧门，也得是最高规格。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-05-38.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;故宫熙和门，81颗门钉&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;孔庙的大成门，门钉也是同样形制。再看大成殿，也是最高规格的建筑形制。孔庙在清朝最后一次大修缮是光绪年间，足见满清政权对儒家文化的认同与接纳。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-04-06.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;大成殿的气魄&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;孔庙主殿大成殿中，陈列了许多乐器，编钟、编磬等。儒家文化讲究礼乐，经常听到一个词叫礼崩乐坏。我们常常把礼乐作为一个整体看待。实际上它就是字面的意思，拆开看是两件事。在儒家观念中，礼仪与音乐是密不可分的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-06-32.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;这组铜编钟保存程度非常好，极其罕见&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;编磬&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="国子监"&gt;国子监
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;隔壁国子监是明清最高学府，建于元朝，年龄比紫禁城大。太学门背后的琉璃牌坊气场很强，是中国唯一一座为教育设立的牌坊。四根立柱分别代表功、名、利、禄。建筑上雕了有许多莲花钉，喜得连科的含义。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-08-29.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;琉璃牌坊，两侧的立柱没有拍进来&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;国子监正中大殿辟雍，是专供皇帝讲学用的场所，这种功能的建筑，世界仅此一座。乾隆皇帝之后，新皇帝继位，都要来这里做一次讲学，以示对教育的重视。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;正要进辟雍瞧瞧，被东侧的一个科举考试历史展览吸引了。跑去详细了解了一番，非常有意思。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="科举制度"&gt;科举制度
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;古代选拔人才制度经历过这些不同方式。经常在古文中听到的“举孝廉”，就是汉代察举制的一项考核项目。几种不同制度相比，科举的确比较能促进阶层流动，是不小的进步。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-10-34.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;汉代察举制会派专车来接候选人进京任职。忽然想到一个耳熟能详的历史事件：公车上书。这才恍然大悟，其中的公车一词，指的是知识分子这个群体。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-10-50.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;到唐代，科举制开始发展。并且产生许多细分科目，招募文学、自然科学、医学、武学等各领域人才。并且开始接受外邦人通过科举入朝为官。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-11-46.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宋朝开了殿试的先河，并且反作弊制度已经相对完善。考生的试卷会让专人重新抄写一遍，用印泥将姓名封上，再交给阅卷官。防止阅卷官认出考生，打人情分。阅卷官以优良中差劣5档标准给考卷判分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-11-19.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;到元、明、清三朝，曾经各种不同的科目，被废除得只剩下进士一门。随着科举制度逐渐成熟固化，阶层流动又开始变缓慢了。清朝初年，官员子弟考中进士比例远高于平民。康熙采用了分卷的办法，官与民录取名额各自独立，互不影响。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于科举，我能想到的就是乡试会试殿试。但实际上，古代平民要走上仕途，有6关要过：童试、乡试、会试、殿试、朝考、散馆。其中童试是科举的资格考试，考过了才能参加科举。乡试在省里考，中央会派官员去监考。乡试考中就能称为举人。乡试第一名叫解元。会试要赶到北京来考，考试地点是紫禁城外的贡院。会试第一名叫会元。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;殿试考的主要是文化，但书法也很重要。科举考试和文书编纂工作一律用馆阁体，这是一种工整的小楷字体。乾隆朝的一次殿试，有个叫刘凤诰的举人一直答到了天黑。监考官三番五次催他都不肯交卷，正准备把他轰出去。礼部尚书来他旁边看了一眼，发现这人书法真好，于是下令给他蜡烛，让他答完。果然，他就拿下了那届的探花。后来乾隆会见新科进士，发现刘凤诰身材矮小其貌不扬，就出了个对子考验他：东启明，西长庚，南箕北斗，朕乃摘星手。刘凤诰马上就对出来了：春牡丹，夏芍药，秋菊冬梅，臣为探花郎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了文化和书法，还有因为名字改变命运的。嘉靖朝一次殿试，一甲前三名有两人分别叫秦鸣雷和吴情。论实力，理应是吴情中状元。但是嘉靖觉得这名字不好，恰逢那年又大旱，鸣雷就有雨，于是把这状元给了秦鸣雷。吴情只得了个探花。当时有人写打油诗讽刺这件事：吴情举子无情帝，鸣雷只好捡便宜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;殿试一甲前三名只有3人，二甲和三甲人数就不固定了。不同等级，仕途前程大不相同。如果止步于殿试，就很可能去地方上任职，将来升迁很难。为了靠近中央、靠近皇权，大部分进士还会继续考翰林院。翰林院相当于一个研究生学府。有统计表明，明朝的大学士有90%来自翰林院，这是仕途的快车道。翰林院的入学考试就叫朝考。考入翰林院的进士称为庶吉士，一甲前三名免考。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;翰林院毕业考试叫散馆。散馆会把庶吉士分为三批。第一批留馆，做一些编修类工作，同时有机会给皇子当老师。官职六、七品，升迁非常快。第二批部分会留馆，也有部分会分配到六部工作。第三批就不分配了，退回官圈等待聘用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;科举考卷&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从科举历史展出来，再想看国子监的其他故事已经来不及了，景点就要闭馆。这一天的行程告一段落。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第四天颐和园"&gt;第四天：颐和园
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;颐和园的行程不像前几天那么严肃，这里发生的历史事件不如故宫和恭王府密集，以观景为主。以这轻松休闲的最后一天，结束整趟旅行，也是挺不错的安排。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;来到颐和园就有种熟悉的感觉。像我这种来自江浙的游客，一见如故。因为乾隆有极重的江南情结，六次下江南不够，还直接把江南搬到颐和园来了（当时还称作清漪园）。苏州街复制了江南水乡，谐趣园复制了江南园林，昆明湖复制了整个杭州西湖。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;慈禧很喜欢苏州街。每次要来这里游玩，就有大量宫女太监假扮成这里的居民、商人、游客，模仿真实的水乡小镇情形。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宫女&amp;amp;太监：楚门秀第76场，各就各位，Action！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="万寿山"&gt;万寿山
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;我是从北宫门进的颐和园，这边是万寿山的背后。过了苏州街就直接是山顶的四大部洲，一座藏传佛教建筑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-14-09.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;从北侧仰望四大部洲&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;背面看不觉得有什么妙处。绕到正面的昆明湖边，再重新爬一遍万寿山，建筑的气势一下就出来了。建筑本身与故宫相比当然远远不及，但借助山势层层升高，又有另一种自然的庄严。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;山脚下是慈禧办过盛大寿辰的排云殿。寿辰当天，光绪皇帝都不得不在偏殿等候。清朝统治者大多信藏传佛教，排云殿后方的德晖殿，可以说是世俗权威和宗教权威的过渡。经过这里，就踏入佛国。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;佛：签证都不用的吗！你们人间就这么草率吗？

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;在排云殿仰望德晖殿与佛香阁&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;台阶狭窄，没多少地方立足。站在台阶上仰望佛香阁，非常高大。剧烈的尺寸对比很令人震撼。转过身来，在佛香阁前俯瞰整个昆明湖，一览无遗。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-16-13.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;逐级往上，看到众香界以及智慧海的佛像阵列。大量重复产生很强的视觉冲击。低矮处的佛像头部被八国联军取走了，今天看到的是修复的结果，所以佛头显得特别新。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-18-40.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;智慧海墙面佛像&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最高处是兼具宫廷与藏传佛教风格的四大部洲，从正面爬上去略有一种攀登布宫的感觉。有那么几个瞬间，我觉得自己似乎来到了拉萨。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-18-02.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;往东侧下山后，来到昆明湖旁。从湖边的开阔地再回望万寿山，刚才攀登过程一目了然。沿山而上，的确庄严肃穆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-20-16.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="仁寿殿与德和园"&gt;仁寿殿与德和园
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;除了紫禁城外，此行见到的最气派的建筑，估计就要数这仁寿殿了。慈禧大权独揽时，偏爱住在颐和园。仁寿殿就相当于这里的太和殿，重大典礼、接见外国使臣等都在此进行。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-20-59.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;仁寿殿门前龙、凤各两只，正中央一座铜麒麟雕像。特殊之处在于，两只凤居中央，龙靠边，这一看就是慈禧的手笔。殿前区域不像太和殿那样具有阳刚之气（毕竟大铜狮往那儿一摆，也是没谁了），但配上松、石、铜鼎，自带另一种长者威严。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;长者：没有狗头？你确定？
&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/dog.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;慈禧爱听戏。我老婆说如果放在今天，肯定就是个宅女，天天追剧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在仁寿殿北侧，是德和园大戏楼。好家伙！比故宫的畅音阁气派多了。形式差不多，但整个是个升级版。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-22-32.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;德和园院落的影壁，阳光角度刚刚好，斜照在门口这株紫薇上&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;大戏楼一角&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;慈禧不仅自己听，还喜欢拉着大臣们一起听。德和园正对面的颐乐殿是慈禧本人的观戏台，左右两侧大半圈是给大臣们用的观戏廊。慈禧觉得一起听戏是赏赐，大臣们可不这么认为。这园子里没有厕所，大臣们听戏途中想要方便，只能偷偷贿赂太监开个小门，搭梯子出去。沿着小道去厕所方便。所以这条小道也被称为快活小道。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-30-03.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;两侧回廊都是大臣观戏的包厢&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大臣：我闪了，要是老佛爷点名，帮我喊个到。

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;德和园区域是三进院落，颐乐殿背后还有一进，主要作为观戏期间的休息场所。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="谐趣园"&gt;谐趣园
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;颐和园太大，一天时间只能有选择地游玩。作为杭州来的游客，首先就放弃了昆明湖的大片区域。不过，在颐和园东北角的谐趣园还是发现了惊喜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一座非常精巧的江南园林，颐和园里的园中之园。建筑是皇家建筑，单檐卷棚歇山顶。这种同时带有秀气与贵气的园林，江南几乎见不到，让人眼前一亮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;园中最出名的是知鱼桥，桥面低矮，是最佳观鱼点。桥的名字是乾隆起的，出自庄子与惠子那出名的哲学“抬杠”，子非鱼安知鱼之乐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;乾隆：朕就是知道，咋地？你接着杠啊！

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;知鱼桥上拍的池塘一角&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="美丽的角落"&gt;美丽的角落
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;除了这3大区域，颐和园内还有许多偏僻却美丽的角落，游人很少。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;万寿山的东边，有这么一座多宝琉璃塔。佛塔的表面整齐排列着大量佛像，与万寿山上的智慧海遥相呼应。塔没有开放，但是可以沿着墙绕塔一周，也算近在咫尺。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-32-57.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;多宝琉璃塔的东北方向，是澹宁堂。这是很独立的一个建筑群，前不着村后不着店。澹宁堂北侧是颐和园的后湖。后湖极其狭长，更像是条河。从河北岸南望，便能感受到这种特别的静谧之美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-33-27.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;澹宁堂附近的一座桥也极具特色，是绝佳的拍照地点。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而且，临近傍晚时分，有漫天的卷云和卷积云，天气非常给力！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="北京见闻"&gt;北京见闻
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="住宿"&gt;住宿
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;在北京总共待了4天5夜。前3晚住在张自忠路的一处民宿，靠近南锣鼓巷。屋子很小，但设计温馨，室内干净，交通也是四通八达。找到这样的民宿需要一点运气。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/20190921_003617.gif"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;窗外还能看到一小片四合院&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后2晚的住处就很坑了。也是民宿，和图片里完全不一样，根本就不是同一套房子。脏兮兮的，体验很差。位置还不准确，和地图标注不在同一处，去地铁站得打车。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;住宿方面有两点教训分享：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;选择住处交通优先。在地铁发达的城市，要充分信任公共交通的效率。中途没必要换住处。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;看起来性价比远高于正常水平的住处要当心，往往有其他问题。租金是很市场化的，不要抱侥幸心理。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="饮食"&gt;饮食
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;这4天的中午基本都在景区里度过，为了多游玩一些地方，没少啃面包。晚上才有机会品尝当地特色。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一晚的晚餐印象很深。出了故宫神武门，往西绕过景山公园，再往北一头扎进恭俭胡同。胡同深处藏着一座旧时的皇家冰窖，如今被改造成了餐馆。里面还完整保存了当年存放冰块的地窖。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-36-25.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-36-37.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;冰在明清时期属于御用品。每年冬天有采冰人将湖面冰层切割成块，运到北京各处冰窖存放。采冰归工部管理。采冰人是个很苦的职业，重体力活。世代延续，不得辞职。冰块统一切成一尺五寸见方，使用时能刚好与冰鉴吻合。在冰窖里一存就是半年，夏天再取出来用。冰块甚至还作为一种重要的恩典，可以赏赐给大臣使用，称为颁冰。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;冰是一个很敏感的字，谐音同兵。这也是皇帝要垄断使用权的原因之一。朱棣盘算着起兵推翻建文帝，曾找来他的谋士，道衍和尚姚广孝，想探探他的态度。朱棣也不明说，出了个上联：天寒地冻，水无一点不成冰。姚广孝马上明白了，回下联：国乱民忧，王不出头谁做主。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;说回当地特色饮食，烤鸭和铜碳火锅我觉得还挺不错。不过这两种店都开遍全国了，在别处也吃过，同样地道，这回就没品尝。再加上有两晚和同学聚餐，分别吃了一顿西餐和一顿新疆菜。实际品尝到的北京传统小吃没几样，而且真吃不惯：爆肚、卤煮、炒肝……北京的下水吃法非常多。我不爱吃下水，而且这些做法对我来说，腥味去除得不够彻底。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-36-50.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;皇家冰窖餐厅的鸡汁萝卜、爆肚、以及配爆肚的芝麻酱&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-37-09.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;鼓楼脚下的姚记炒肝，左上至
右下分别为：杏仁豆腐、卤煮、配卤煮的蒜醋汁、炸酱面、炒肝&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;查了一下，许多说法认为清末北京百姓穷，所以被迫尝试各种边角料。我觉得有可能要反过来看这个问题，是人们主动选择了这些食材。因为下水在北京便宜，相当便宜！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;正是因为生活优渥的王侯将相们的存在，北京每天的活牲畜消耗量大得惊人。肉被消耗掉了，冰窖又只允许皇家用，下水没法保存和长途运输，在市场上严重泛滥。下水价格可能会明显低于其他城市。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而且我猜由于皇家礼制方面因素，明清时期北京的肉类需求比其他城市刚性得多。无论经济如何下滑，肉类消耗量都不怎么减少。所以越是到了晚清经济衰败，北京市场上的下水反而越便宜。这才有成为一方特色饮食的规模基础。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;找到一篇文章，也是从同一个角度讲。但是没有提北京单个城市的下水消耗：&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.douban.com/note/666792033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.douban.com/note/666792033/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有就是豆汁儿，那天去恭王府路上买了一杯。这东西是绿豆发酵产生，绿豆的主要成分是糖和蛋白质。发酵出来味道肯定很猎奇。小店老板也很有意思，用一次性纸杯接了一小杯。我老婆问，就这么点啊？老板说，你要是喝完，我再给你倒。老婆抿了一口，就扔旁边垃圾桶了，说有一股浓郁的臭鸡蛋味。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;老板：嘿！您这就走啦？不再续一杯？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除了传统小吃，在国子监附近的箭厂胡同拔草了一家很厉害的甜品店。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="趣闻"&gt;趣闻
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;记得第一晚刚到北京时，火车站根本打不到车。乘了摆渡车去远一点的地方打车。司机师傅那一口京腔，听了相当提精气神。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-42-52.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;摆渡车坐一站，然后就很好打车&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后几天也是一样。各地的网约车司机，通常都会有自己的司机群，等红灯的时候语音聊上几句。北京的司机聊天，那画风完全不一样。群里大家伙七嘴八舌在夸一个拿到当天奖励、准备收工的司机，跟群口相声似的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“得！还是您牛逼。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“差一单，我可吃了大亏喽。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;等红绿灯时，还看到过很温暖的一幕。有位大爷骑着一辆带棚的三轮车过马路。地面略微有点上坡，大爷蹬得挺吃力。背后的棚里坐着位老太太，八成是他老伴儿。老太太伸出双腿，一脚一脚地配合着蹬地面。过了这段坡地，老太太又坐回了棚里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一幕让我想起了……力的作用是相互的！！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在北京的最后一晚，同学请客吃新疆菜。这家餐馆的主菜是一大盘椒麻鸡，分量很足。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2019-09/2019-09-20-23-43-43.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同学说这和东北菜还是没法比，她之前去东北出差，“锅包肉这么大一块”，她伸手笔划了下。想吃点精致的东西时，她就跑去吃日料。东北的日料也是入乡随俗，虽然还是寿司手卷刺身那些东西，但分量都大一倍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这简直开启了新世界啊！食量大，爱吃日料，就得去东北，紫腚管够！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同学住在西直门区域，这里号称宇宙中心（笑）。我也去三里屯逛过，相比之下，西直门这一带城区不是那么新，怎么看都没有宇宙中心的样子。其实关键在于这里有大量名校，人群有明显的分层，共同支撑起了非常立体的商业。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;回到杭州，立刻决定以后要再去北京。北京的古迹、胡同、自然景观、博物馆、展览，根本没有尽头，去多少次都有新收获。这次是野心太大，有点走马观花了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同时，我感觉自己还不够爱自己生活的城市，了解也不够，近在咫尺反而懈怠了。有必要转换心态，试着以游客的身份常常重游杭州，了解自己生活的土地。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Old Tales from World of Warcraft</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3574/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 17:02:35 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3574/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Some old World of Warcraft stories came to mind. I joined late, during the Burning Crusade. I played off and on until Warlords of Draenor, and haven&amp;rsquo;t touched an MMO since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite mixed opinions, WoW is undeniably a legendary MMO. Its classic status comes from a vast world, diverse classes, and a wealth of details and Easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being a newbie Night Elf priest, teaming up with a classmate in the Scarlet Monastery library. After clearing some enemies, I randomly opened a book on a table, and it actually detailed Azeroth&amp;rsquo;s history. I told everyone, &amp;ldquo;Hold up, check this out,&amp;rdquo; and started reading. Suddenly, our paladin charged in with a train of mobs, and we wiped&amp;hellip; But nobody yelled at me. After, we all spent half an hour reading that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These details are an obvious reason for WoW&amp;rsquo;s success, making it feel real. But there&amp;rsquo;s another factor: the language barrier between Alliance and Horde. It&amp;rsquo;s a subtle but crucial design choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, in Terokkar Forest, I saw two Horde players fighting that big bone dragon. I&amp;rsquo;d already done that quest. The dragon was huge, visually stunning as it swooped down. Figuring we&amp;rsquo;re all players, I decided to help. But as soon as I dismounted (un-cat-formed, rather), the Orc warrior charged me, while the Troll hunter kept attacking the dragon. His pet got swatted and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the warrior panicked, thinking I was there to grief them. He had a point. That quest was brutal, requiring you to collect items and kill mobs to summon the dragon. Failing meant starting over. Seeing me dismount, he must have gotten anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ignored him, cast Fear, and went all-out on the dragon. I even pulled aggro; Shadow Priests were strong in TBC. The Orc realized my intention, turned back to the dragon, and even taunted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dragon fell, the Horde players looted, and looked at me. They probably thought I wanted to do the quest too. But we couldn&amp;rsquo;t communicate. I jumped a few times, they jumped back, and I mounted up and left. That&amp;rsquo;s my most memorable cross-faction moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened occasionally; sometimes Horde players even helped me unprompted. Actual PvP was rare; mostly, people minded their own business. Trusting each other without communication is also rare, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unique fun is missing from most MMOs, and it made WoW incredibly immersive. It&amp;rsquo;s like drivers interacting without words, using only lights and honks to express goodwill, malice, humility, or anger. I wondered, why did jumping become the default way to show friendliness? How did that convention start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting. Players from opposing factions are on edge, relying on body language. Standing still increases tension. Speed is key. Emotes like bowing are slow. The readily available actions, besides some harmless spells, are moving and jumping. Spells like Levitate vary by class and aren&amp;rsquo;t standard (and who has Levitate hotkeyed&amp;hellip;?). Movement can be aggressive, especially a melee class running at you. Running away ends things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumping is all that&amp;rsquo;s left. Harmless, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the standoff. But this extra action defuses tension. Like in real life, when things get heated, someone needs to break the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in a virtual world, players rely on basic instincts. Even with communication cut off, if there&amp;rsquo;s interaction, people find a way to express themselves. It reminds me of another game: Journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent fundamental design makes a classic. Engaging these primal instincts should be the focus, rather than shoehorning IPs onto existing gameplay. Perhaps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Classics are often complex enough, but not overly complex.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>魔兽世界的陈年往事</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3574/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 17:02:35 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3574/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;偶然想起魔兽世界里的陈年旧事。这个游戏我加入得晚，70年代才开始玩，中间玩玩停停，一直到钢铁部落那个版本，之后就再也没碰过网游了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;虽然如今褒贬不一，但这绝对是一款可以载入史册的泰斗级网游。它除了宏大的世界观、丰富的职业发展方向，还有大量用心的细节和彩蛋，成就了它的经典。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;记得我还是个暗夜精灵小牧师的时候，跟同学组队去打血色图书馆。清完一组敌人，随手翻开桌上的一本书，里面真的在详细介绍艾泽拉斯的历史。于是在聊天窗里说大家等等，我们先来看看这书讲什么吧，然后津津有味看起来。看着看着就发现我们的圣骑士开着一列火车向我奔来，然后团灭……但是我没有挨骂，打完副本之后同学几个一起在里面看了半个小时的书。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这些细节是魔兽世界成功显而易见的原因，让游戏变得真实，更容易把现实生活投射到其中。不过还有一个因素我以前从来没想过：联盟和部落语言不通。这是个非常不起眼的基础设定，但是至关重要。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在泰罗卡森林做任务的时候，看见两个部落正在杀那条大骨龙。这个任务我已经做过了。骨龙真的很大，人站在地面看着它俯冲下来攻击你，视觉效果是非常震撼的。想着都是玩家嘛，上去帮一把。结果我一下马（其实是豹），兽人战士就冲锋过来砍我了，巨魔猎人则在继续应付那条龙，他的宠物被骨龙扇了几巴掌倒下了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想来这战士估计是慌了，以为我要来捣乱。说实话他的担心是很有道理的。这个任务非常麻烦，召唤骨龙需要收集任务道具，要杀很多怪，如果任务失败，整个过程要重头来过。看到我一下马，他肯定急了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我也没管那么多，把战士恐惧开，然后火力全开轰那条龙。甚至把仇恨都拉过来了，70年代的暗牧还是很猛的。兽人战士也明白了我的意图，调头回去砍那条龙，还帮忙嘲讽。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;骨龙倒下，两个部落捡完尸体，看着我。可能是觉得我也在做这个任务，想等我召唤了再帮我杀一次。但是我没法和他们沟通，按空格键原地跳了几下，他们也跟着跳几下，然后我就上马走了。这是我印象最深刻的一次敌对阵营合作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这样的合作在野外时有发生，有时也有部落主动来帮我。印象中真正见面就动手的还是少数，大多数情况是各顾各的相安无事。当然，能够在语言不通的情况下相互信任也是少见的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这就是其他绝大多数网游都没有的乐趣，让游戏无比真实、有代入感。就像两个司机在路上的互动，没有语言，全靠闪灯鸣笛来表达善意与恶意、谦逊与愤怒。我后来在想，联盟部落如果要相互示好，表明没有敌意，为什么基本都是原地跳或者胡乱蹦跶。怎么就形成了这样的惯例？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其实这个问题很有趣，双方遭遇时彼此都会绷紧神经，但又只能借助肢体语言。如果站着不动，往往适得其反，紧张氛围只会加剧。这个场合最需要的是快，第一时间表明来意。虽然有许多鞠躬、跳舞之类的动作，但是输入指令很慢。能顺手做的动作，除了一些无害技能，就只有移动和跳了。像漂浮术这样的无害技能或许也有效果，但每个职业不同，无法形成规范（况且有多少牧师会像我这样给漂浮术设快捷键的……）。移动则有一定的侵犯意味，尤其是当一个近战职业向你跑来时。如果往反方向跑，互动也就结束了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;剩下的就只有跳了，完全无害，对当前对峙局面没有任何实质改变。但就是这个多余的、没有实质改变的动作，恰恰能缓和气氛。这就和现实中一样，谈话气氛闹僵了，需要有人来打个圆场。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;即使是在一个完全陌生的虚拟世界中，玩家们仍然是在用人类最原始的本能做决策、理解他人。即使斩断了沟通的渠道，只要有办法互动，人就能找到表达的方法。这让我想起另一款游戏，在这方面极为相似：风之旅人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;优秀的基础设定，是一款游戏成为经典的关键因素。广泛、深入地调动这些人类原始本能，才是思考的重点。而不是往现成玩法上生硬地套当红IP。此处或许可以把那句流传甚广的话反过来说：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“经典往往足够复杂，但不能过于复杂。”​​​&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Tug-of-War at the Garage Gate</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3605/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 12:53:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3605/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Our apartment complex has an underground garage, a bit of a trek from the north gate. It&amp;rsquo;s fully automated, no guard needed. Management doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for a guard, so they banned residents from walking through – north gate only. But some folks &lt;em&gt;despise&lt;/em&gt; detours and will do anything to sneak through. I&amp;rsquo;ve lived here two years, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a constant, ridiculous battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the gate had a single bar, with gaps on the sides. Easy peasy to squeeze through. The gate was always malfunctioning then, so a guard was posted, manually letting cars in. He ignored pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gate got fixed, the guard left. Management extended the bar, nearly flush with the walls. No problem – residents just ducked under. Still worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, they upgraded the gate: two bars with mesh between them. No more ducking, and you&amp;rsquo;d need serious hops to clear it. Crawling, of course, was still an option&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But residents just waited. Grandmas with groceries, ladies with strollers, all hanging out. When a car approached, they&amp;rsquo;d rush in while the gate was open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting is a drag, though. Who knows when a car will show up? Some residents got antsy and started squeezing past the wall. I noticed the paint near the gate arms was all rubbed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim folks could manage, but larger ones weren&amp;rsquo;t deterred. The gate&amp;rsquo;s ends got wrecked. The extensions were flimsy KT board, easily snapped. The mesh, seemingly metal, had bits near the wall torn off, dangling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management fixed it, it broke again. Repeat. A few times, the whole gate was removed for major repairs, leaving just the bare, rusty bar – pretty sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I saw a new tactic! Management smeared this sticky, nasty, reddish-brown gunk – oil or glue, who knows – all over the walls by the gate. I burst out laughing! Talk about a deterrent! Squeeze through, ruin your clothes. But the entrance looks like a disaster zone, like someone&amp;rsquo;s trying to collect a debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure the detour-haters will figure something out. Maybe cardboard or plastic wrap stuck to the wall, using the gunk as adhesive while protecting their clothes. I can picture someone doing that, feeling all smug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>地下车库道闸的拉锯战</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3605/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 12:53:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3605/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;我的小区有一个专门的地下车库出入口，离小区北门有一段距离。车辆出入完全靠摄像头识别，不需要人看守。物业不想在这里安排人手，所以禁止业主从车辆出入口步行进出，必须走北门。也有些业主就是不愿意绕路，千方百计要从地下车库进出。住进来的2年内，见证了双方在这个地方进行了一轮又一轮的攻防战，相当精彩。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;起初，车库出入口的道闸只有一根横杠，离两边的墙还有一段距离，行人只要侧个身就能过去。那时的道闸还没有完全调试好，经常坏，有个保安常年驻守在这个门口，手动给车主开闸。保安从来只管车，也不管人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;道闸调试好之后，这里的保安也就撤了。物业把道闸横杠加长了，几乎是贴着墙了。这对业主来说没什么难的，侧身变成弯腰就是了，照样可以钻进钻出。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一段时间之后，物业改造了这里的道闸。把一根横杠换成了上下两根横杠、中间网状的那种。弯腰是进不去了，跨栏也得有运动员的水准。当然，如果愿意匍匐前进，那还是可以过得去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是业主仍然有办法从这里进出，就一个字，等。经常看到提着菜的大妈们、推着婴儿车的大姐们，堵在这里聊天。一有车辆进出，她们就趁开闸的那几秒钟鱼贯而入。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是等终究不是办法，谁知道下一辆车什么时候来呢？显然有些业主没那么多耐心，他们选择侧身贴着墙，强行挤进去。从某个时候开始，我注意到道闸起落杆两头的墙面，基本上都被磨秃了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;身材较瘦的业主能勉强进去，胖一点的也不甘心绕道啊。久而久之，道闸的两端就被挤坏了，横杠的延长部分是KT板做的，随便一挤就断了。中间的网状结构看着像是金属的，靠墙的几根脱落了，松松垮垮地垂在那里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;物业派人来修，很快又会被挤坏。来来往往，反反复复。其中有好几回，道闸整个栏杆都拆下来大修，剩下横杠中间那根光秃秃、锈迹斑斑的芯，看着怪凄凉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天回来一看，哟！物业又出新招了。在道闸两头的墙面涂了一大片粘乎乎、脏兮兮的东西，红褐色的，不知道是油还是胶，当场就把我逗乐了。这家伙震慑力了得啊！照以前的挤法，挤一次就毁一件衣服。只是这地下车库经过这么一折腾，看起来实在不怎么雅观，还以为有人上门催债来了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过我相信，道高一尺，魔高一丈。死活不肯绕路的业主，一定能找到应对办法。说不定哪天就能看到墙面贴了一大块纸板箱，或者保鲜膜，刚好靠这些粘乎乎的东西固定在墙上，同时又能保护衣服。我现在都能想象，如果真有人出手这么做，Ta心里会觉得自己多么机智。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;谁知道呢？&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>永辉超市见闻</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3568/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2018 21:19:14 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3568/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;在西溪银泰偶然发现一家永辉超市，进去逛了一下，还是挺有收获的。这个超市看起来平淡无奇，普通的货架、普通的摆设，也没什么高科技，但是许多细节值得思考。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2018-01/01-14/1.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;卖三文鱼的冷柜旁边，摆了芥末、Rio鸡尾酒之类的商品。说明超市经营者不是按自己的逻辑来布置的，否则这些东西都应该放到调料、酒类货架去，这么摆是从消费者的真实场景出发考虑的。消费者买三文鱼回家当刺身吃，就是为了偶尔吃点好的，相应的搭配都在旁边准备好，有利于趁着大好心情促成消费。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2018-01/01-14/2.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;超市里还提供这种儿童的购物推车。这种推车容量小，和普通推车相比毫无优势，似乎没什么意义。其实这对于全家前来购物的很有效，现场观察发现，小孩很喜欢这个东西。出于模仿的天性，看到大人推车自己也要推一个，让儿童在超市里可以安心跟着父母购物，减少无聊，不容易吵闹着要回家。也就间接地提升了父母的购物体验。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2018-01/01-14/3.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;服务细节也有亮点。在卖冰冻生鲜的柜台，营业员在有空闲的时候，会把保鲜袋撑开成这种形状，方便经过的消费者直接使用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整个超市里人气最旺的就是生鲜区，比零食、干货等区域的人多多了，相比非常悬殊。生鲜的价格的确不贵，许多与菜场相当，即使贵也贵不过20%。生鲜的品相非常好，看起来很新鲜。比如带鱼，个头都很大，而且大小基本一致，不像菜场里大大小小很不标准。多数生鲜商品都这样，尺寸很规整。能做到这一点，说明永辉超市对供应链的掌控能力强于许多超市。同时价格却没有贵很多，仔细一想，我认为这也许能反映出新零售的不同之处，新零售其实不需要什么花里胡哨的新玩法新模式，永辉超市背后很可能有一套高度数字化的供应链管理系统，通过信息化与大数据，就把传统采购流程中的低效率和损耗给降下来了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2018-01/01-14/4.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有最后一点，今天发现超市内的布局比较特别。一般超市内的通道都是网状的，一排排货架中间就是道路，横几条竖几条。场地大的超市，比如沃尔玛这样，通道有几十条；场地小的，像小区旁边的世纪联华，可能只有几条，但形式都是一样的。在这种结构中，消费者的动线是乱的，完全随机。而永辉超市里的通道很像宜家，也像跟团旅游时被导游拉去购物的纪念品店，出口和入口不在一起，从入口到出口只有唯一一条主干道。主干道两边的小通道都很短，站在主干道上一眼就能看出有没有自己要买的品类。我认为这样购物效率会提升，不会让顾客在超市里毫无意义瞎转逗留，相同面积的商场，这种策略可以提升单位时间接待的人流量。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个是永辉超市，不是永辉超级物种。今天赶着回家做饭，买了些冰冻大虾和酸奶就走了，没来得及仔细观察，下次再好好逛一逛。细节出效果，不是非得把行业搅得翻天覆地，才叫创新和进步。另外，果然还是应该多出门见见世面，去现场亲身体验，好过看上百篇科技报导啊。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Two Packs of Aojiru</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3525/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2016 00:43:28 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3525/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of instant drinks at home – red dates, goji berries, milk, chrysanthemum, sanqi flowers, honey, you name it. This year, I discovered aojiru, a powdered barley leaf drink. I&amp;rsquo;m not in it for the health benefits; it just tastes good, kind of like matcha. It&amp;rsquo;s great with milk and oatmeal for breakfast. I had two brands: one was pure barley leaf powder, the other had matcha, sugar, and other additives. It tasted bland, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, I finished the bland one. I was secretly relieved, thinking, &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t buy that again.&amp;rdquo; But then it hit me – why did I power through the bad one first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit complicated. I first noticed this habit in elementary school. My mom sometimes picked me up for lunch since my school was nearby. We&amp;rsquo;d grab a quick lunchbox. I loved meat; a chicken drumstick made my day. My mom&amp;rsquo;s coworker noticed I always ate the other food first, saving the drumstick for last. She said, &amp;ldquo;Your son is a pessimist. He saves the best for last.&amp;rdquo; That was the first time I realized not everyone thinks like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In school, this was a good thing. My parents and teachers saw me as disciplined, finishing homework before playing. I&amp;rsquo;d sneak out of bed to play games, but never before homework was done. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I loved studying, but it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this approach isn&amp;rsquo;t always a hit. Take my grandparents. They have a storage room full of things their kids gave them – clothes, kitchenware, you name it. They won&amp;rsquo;t use anything new until the old stuff breaks, which drives everyone nuts. Thankfully, they&amp;rsquo;ve loosened up, taking more time to enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lady&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;pessimist&amp;rdquo; comment wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right. You could call it optimism, depending on your focus. So, what&amp;rsquo;s the real difference between sooner or later? It&amp;rsquo;s about worldview, two ways of seeing the world, leading to two strategies: gathering and sowing. Gatherers are past-oriented. They see a static world where every bit used is a loss, so they hoard to reach goals. Sowers are present-oriented. They see a dynamic world where consumption fuels gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds cliché, right? Like &amp;ldquo;carpe diem&amp;rdquo;? But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to misjudge yourself. I thought I was a sower because I&amp;rsquo;m easygoing. But the aojiru made me rethink. I have this habit of keeping things &lt;em&gt;just so&lt;/em&gt;. If I move something, I put it back immediately. When cooking, I&amp;rsquo;ll grab the salt, use it, and put it back – repeatedly. I even did something ridiculous: I started washing the egg-beating bowl &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; the egg was cooking. The heat was too high, and the egg burned. This weird quirk shows I instinctively prefer the existing order, a static worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with cooking, if I keep reaching for salt, the spice rack needs rearranging. Changing the environment takes effort, disrupting the familiar. That&amp;rsquo;s sowing – using energy and prior effort to create efficiency. Sowers use existing resources to make &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; the best, rather than hoarding the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the aojiru. It&amp;rsquo;s a small thing. I could&amp;rsquo;ve saved or tossed the bad one. What&amp;rsquo;s the upside of the good aojiru? One thing: after tasting something good, your sense of &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; sharpens. That improved perception is a gain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>两包青汁</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3525/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2016 00:43:28 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3525/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;家里的冲泡饮品多得数不清，红枣枸杞、牛奶、菊花、三七花、蜂蜜，可以好几天不重样。今年又新发现一种——青汁，这是大麦叶磨成的粉末。功效什么的我不关心，反正挺好喝的，有股抹茶味，加入牛奶燕麦是很不错的早餐饮料。有两包不同品牌的青汁在换着喝，一包成分比较纯，基本只包含大麦叶粉末。另一包里面加入了抹茶粉、白砂糖和一些其他成分，味道偏淡，不香，不太喜欢。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前几天，那包味道偏淡的青汁喝完了，心里小庆幸了一下，以后不要再买这款了。思来想去觉得哪里不对——为什么先喝完的不是好喝的那款呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这牵扯到的问题就复杂了，我第一次意识到这个现象还是小学那会儿。有天中午和我妈去吃午饭，我的小学离她工作单位很近，所以她中午偶尔会来接上我一块儿吃饭。其实也只是找个快餐店吃盒饭，小时候特别爱吃荤菜，一个大鸡腿能让我眼睛发亮。和我妈一起来的同事注意到，我总是把其他菜先吃掉，最后美美地啃那个鸡腿。有个阿姨说，你儿子是个悲观主义者啊，你看他总把喜欢的留在最后。这是我第一次了解到，原来不是每个人的行事风格都像我这样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;学生时代，这个特点非常可贵。在父母老师眼中，我是个自律的好学生，知道先完成学习任务，再去做自己想做的事情。我也会半夜爬起来偷偷玩游戏，但我从没有过先玩游戏再写作业的经历。虽然是否真的因为热爱学习，我表示怀疑，但结果总是好的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，这样的行事风格并非总是会得到认同。比如说——老人家。爷爷奶奶家有一个储藏间，里面堆满各种杂物，都是子女们送的衣服、厨具、家居用品。他们不舍得穿，不舍得用，不把旧的用坏绝不换新，这让大家都很头疼。好在近几年这个状况已经好多了，他们会在享受生活方面多迈几步。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在，我知道那位阿姨对我的悲观主义评价是不准确的。同样的做法，换个角度完全可以理解为乐观主义，就看关注点是在鸡腿还是其他菜上。那么，先还是后，根本区别究竟在哪里？这是个世界观问题，对世界运转规律的两种理解，也相应产生了采集与播撒两种策略。采集者关注过去，在他们眼中，世界是静态的，消耗一分少一分，要通过不断积累来达成自己的目标。播撒者关注现在，在他们眼中，世界是动态的，消耗不是损失，是为了让自己收获更多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是老生常谈吧，不就是及时行乐么？然而实际上谁都可能错估自己的类型。我一直肯定自己是个播撒者，因为我的生活并没有什么清规戒律，随性的很。青汁事件的反思，让我现在不那么确定了。我有一个非常死板的习惯，会下意识维持周围环境不变，如果真的动了什么，也一定会尽快物归原样。例如做菜时，我会伸手去调味篮里拿盐袋，撒完盐立刻放回原处，做3个菜，就翻3次调味篮。我还做过一件非常荒唐的事情，煎蛋饼的时候，放着刚下锅的蛋液不管，先把打鸡蛋用的碗给洗干净了。结果由于火没调小，洗完碗回来，锅里一股糊味儿。这种诡异的强迫症证明一点，我本能倾向于守成，维持世界现有秩序，这仍然是一种静态的世界观。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其实就拿做菜来说，如果要频繁去调味篮里拿盐袋，就说明调味篮的摆放要重新考虑。改变环境需要额外耗费精力，让世界脱离熟悉的状态，推翻了之前对周围环境的经营。这就是一种播撒，消耗的是精力与之前的成果，收获的是更加合理的环境。播撒者有一条基本逻辑，用现有资源，让今天尽可能达到最佳状态，而不是尽可能多地积累最好的资源。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回到青汁，这只是一件微不足道的小事。那包难喝的青汁，可以以后留着慢慢喝，也可以索性扔掉。如果要问，好喝的青汁究竟能比另一包多得到些什么？有一点是肯定的。尝过好东西之后，对于“好”的理解，一定会更准确。认知的提升，就是一种收获。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DIY Rainproof Cardboard Shutters</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3515/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 12:35:56 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3515/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Home renovations present a dilemma: ventilating to remove formaldehyde requires open windows, but rain can damage your floors. I used to think you couldn&amp;rsquo;t have it both ways, resigning myself to constantly opening and closing windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s a simple problem. There are many ways to get airflow &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; keep rain out. High-end options include smart windows (yes, remotely controlled windows exist!), but those are likely overkill. Cheaper solutions exist. A neighbor used a large truck tarp, costing just a few dollars per square meter. But tarps don&amp;rsquo;t protect walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon an article about car window rain guards, and it clicked. Rain guards are like shutters, using the fact that rain doesn&amp;rsquo;t fall upwards. Shutters solve this! No need for custom ones; these are temporary. Custom plastic shutters are also flimsy. Cardboard is ideal – a little cutting and crafting, and you have rainproof shutters. Here&amp;rsquo;s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="materials"&gt;Materials
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/1.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic stuff: wide, clear tape, a utility knife, a pen, and a measuring tape. And cardboard, of course. You probably have tons of boxes after renovating. Choose thicker, sturdier ones with few creases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-1-measure"&gt;Step 1: Measure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure the window. The best way to install these is by wedging them into the window frame. So, make them slightly &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; than the inner frame for a snug fit. Open the window fully, measure, and leave it open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-2-cut"&gt;Step 2: Cut
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut the cardboard to size, then cut out the louvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/2.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first try, so I was conservative. Louvers can be bigger. Spacing can be smaller too – anything over 5cm is strong enough. Ventilation is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave a gap on each side of the louvers, about the width of the tape. This will help later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-3-set-the-angle"&gt;Step 3: Set the Angle
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louvers need an angle, or they&amp;rsquo;ll flap in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, decide which side faces out. I suggest the cleaner side for better tape adhesion, as we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the whole surface later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/3.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flip up a louver and clean its back (likely the dusty side). Cut a roughly 20cm piece of tape. Stick 1/3 of it on the back. Flip it to the front and stick it down at a 45-degree angle. Smooth the louver part first, then the panel. Seal the crease tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/4.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once both ends are taped, the louver is fixed. These two pieces of tape are key – they provide tension. Make the angle wider than you think you need, as it&amp;rsquo;ll get pressed down later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-4-reinforce"&gt;Step 4: Reinforce
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinforce those two key pieces of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/5.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apply a horizontal tape strip, its centerline roughly aligned with the crease. The tape should extend past the louver edges, sticking to the panel. Run your finger along the crease for a tight seal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/6.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The horizontal tape will leave gaps at the louver ends. Add two short, vertical tape strips on each side. If you left a tape-width gap, this step is very precise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press firmly on the vertical strips, minimizing gaps. This slightly lowers the louver, hence the wider initial angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-5-rainproof-the-louvers"&gt;Step 5: Rainproof the Louvers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louver surfaces are most exposed, so they need extra protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/7.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apply a horizontal tape strip, its centerline aligned with the louver&amp;rsquo;s outer edge. The tape should be longer than the louver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fold the excess tape to the back, sticking it down firmly. Start from the middle, then the ends. Seal the louver edges completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/8.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One louver done. Repeat for all louvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="step-6-rainproof-the-rest"&gt;Step 6: Rainproof the Rest
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining areas are simple. Cover any exposed cardboard with tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For extra protection, wrap the entire bottom edge, like the louver edges. This prevents water from soaking in from below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rain-test"&gt;Rain Test
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/9.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was confident, so I tested it. I blasted it with the showerhead for 30 seconds. The back was totally dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s sufficient. It would take a major storm to replicate that. Heavy rain isn&amp;rsquo;t a worry, but strong winds are. I&amp;rsquo;d check them in person during a typhoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installation"&gt;Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/10.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen windows make installation easy. See the right side of the picture? The frame secures the top, left, and bottom, while the open right edge tucks into the screen&amp;rsquo;s groove. Without screens, use tape, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be less wind-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casement windows are even simpler – all four edges can be secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/11.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With three-section screen windows, measure each section separately. In the picture, the top and bottom shutters are separate, each wedged in its groove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the screen inside, you only need to secure the left, right, and bottom. The shutter can be slightly shorter than one section, making installation easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, these are just for ventilation and rain. If you&amp;rsquo;re on a lower floor or in an insecure area, it is best to open and close your windows manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016.08.02 Update:
Wind resistance is the biggest weakness. Width, cardboard stiffness, and creases matter. My wider shutter blew open. It was almost 1m wide, the cardboard was flimsy, and it had been folded. Use high-quality cardboard for wider shutters.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>简易防雨百叶窗</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3515/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 12:35:56 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3515/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;装修中有个非常大的矛盾。如果要散甲醛，最有效的办法就是开窗通风。24小时开窗又不放心，雨打进来地板就毁了。以往观念中从来没有想过开窗和防雨可以兼得，潜意识里觉得没事多跑几趟，多去开开窗，只能这样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个问题经不起细想，花点心思会发现兼顾通风和防雨的办法多得是。高成本的有智能窗户……真的有一种可以用网络远程控制开关的窗户，当然这个我觉得没多少人会选。低成本的也有，我看到隔壁栋就有人在地面铺上一大片防雨布，就是货车上常用的那种，几块钱一平米。不过防雨布的方案我仍然不太放心，因为保护不了墙面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在网上搜索偶然找到一篇不相干的文章，说的是汽车车窗的防雨挡，看到这里，解决方案自然就来了。防雨挡能做到这一点，和百叶窗的原理一模一样啊，就是欺负雨不能从下往上飞，那何不用百叶窗来解决这一矛盾？不必花钱定做百叶窗，只用几个月而已，而且定做的塑料百叶窗是软的，不利于固定。现成的纸板就是非常理想的材料，稍加剪裁加工就能变成防雨百叶窗。下面就来介绍简易百叶窗的制作方法：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="材料"&gt;材料
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/1.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;材料很简单。一卷宽透明胶、一把美工刀、一支笔、一把卷尺。当然还需要纸板，新家装修一定有很多纸箱，从中选一些较厚较硬的，折痕少的更容易加工。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第1步量尺寸"&gt;第1步：量尺寸
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;先测量尺寸。预估一下安装方式，最佳、也是最普遍的安装方式是卡在窗框的槽里。所以尺寸不能刚好等于窗户内框尺寸，要稍微大一圈才能卡得住。把窗户尽量开大，量好尺寸就不要动它了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第2步裁剪"&gt;第2步：裁剪
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;纸板裁成所需尺寸，在上面割出百叶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/2.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;图中是我做的第一扇，经验不足，其实百叶还能再开大些。两片百叶的间距可以再缩小，大于5cm就足够牢固了。毕竟是为了通风嘛。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;百叶两侧离窗边的距离大致和胶带一样宽，为了方便加工，这个后面会讲。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第3步固定百叶角度"&gt;第3步：固定百叶角度
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;百叶要固定在某个角度，不能任由它活动，不然在大风中会合上，影响通风效果。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一步开始前，先考虑纸板的哪一面朝窗外。我建议纸板上灰少、较干净的一面朝窗外。灰少，透明胶才能粘得牢，后面的步骤需要用透明胶铺满整个表面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/3.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;把百叶翻起来，擦干净背面（背面正是灰多的一面）。剪下一段大约20cm长的胶带，1/3贴在背面。然后转到正面来，向下倾斜45°粘贴。先贴好并抹平百叶部分，再贴窗板部分。百叶与窗板交界处的折痕尽可能贴紧，不留空隙。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/4.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两头贴好之后，百叶就被固定在这个角度了。这两根是关键胶带，直接提供了撑开百叶的拉力。百叶张开的角度留大一些，因为后面的加工会把它压下去一点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第4步加固关键胶带"&gt;第4步：加固关键胶带
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;下面要对刚才两条关键胶带进行加固。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/5.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;先横着贴一条，胶带的中轴线大致对准折痕。注意胶带两头要各多出一段，贴到窗板的边缘。用手指沿着折痕扫过来，确保折痕不留空隙。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/6.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;横条胶带在百叶两端会无可避免留下很大空隙，所以需要在两侧再竖着贴两条短胶带进一步加固。如果之前裁剪时按我的建议，百叶两侧留出和胶带一样宽的距离，就会发现此处的加工特别精确和顺手。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;贴竖条胶带时要压紧，尽量缩小横条胶带两端的空隙。正是这一步会略微压低百叶，所以之前固定角度时要故意开大一些。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第5步百叶防雨"&gt;第5步：百叶防雨
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;百叶表面最容易淋到雨，是重点防雨区域。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/7.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;横着贴一条，胶带的中轴线大致对准百叶的外沿。胶带要比百叶长，两头多出一截。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;把胶带悬空的部分翻过去，贴紧背面。先贴中间，然后才能动两头。贴两头的时候，注意一定要封住百叶两侧的边沿，防止进水。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/8.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上面步骤做好，就算是贴好了一片百叶。先把所有百叶都处理好，再来处理其他区域。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="第6步全窗防雨"&gt;第6步：全窗防雨
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;其余部分的防雨就很简单了，看见有纸板暴露的地方就一条条贴过去就好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果想处理得仔细一点，可以把整个窗板的底端包一下。手法就和包百叶外沿一样。可以防止雨水积在窗框槽里，从底端渗进纸板。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="防雨测试"&gt;防雨测试
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/9.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;完成之后，我很自信地做了一下防雨测试。花洒开到最大，对着表面喷了半分钟，背面滴水未沾，毫无浸湿痕迹。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有这个水平就足够了，要狂风暴雨才能达到类似的效果。其实雨再大都不担心，就怕刮大风。若遇到台风天气，我想还是亲自去检验一下为好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="安装"&gt;安装
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/10.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果家里装了纱窗，安装条件就最为理想。请看右图，因为窗框只能固定住纸窗的上、左、下3条边，空着的右边刚好可以卡在纱窗缝里。如果没有纱窗，再贴一条透明胶固定在窗上也行，不过抗风程度就要打些折扣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;平开式窗户更简单，4条边都可以卡住。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-07/07-30/11.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果装了三段式纱窗，那么尺寸就不能按整个窗户来量了。每片纱窗对应一扇百叶。图中的百叶窗上下两块是独立的，分别卡在各自的槽里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于内侧有纱窗的存在，就不必每条边都卡住了，能卡住左、右、下3边就足够牢固了。所以百叶窗的整体高度可以比一片纱窗稍微矮一点，不然安装很困难。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，提醒一下。这个纸百叶仅仅是为了解决通风和防雨的矛盾，如果你的房子楼层低，小区周边治安差，那还是勤快点多跑跑吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016.08.02 更新：
纸板百叶最大的软肋是抗风能力，对宽度、纸板硬度、折痕非常敏感。最近几天风大，我家那扇较宽的百叶被吹开了。它有近1m宽，纸板也不够硬，制成百叶之前铺在地上被反复折叠踩踏。所以较宽的百叶窗，一定要用优质的纸板来制作。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>繁华落空时</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3512/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 18:32:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3512/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://music.163.com/#/song?id=417859220" target="_blank"&gt;马頔 - 皆非&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;外公过世了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上周的事情，这是第一位去世的直系亲属。他的离开，真正让我感受到了生命的渺小。原来从满面红光精神抖擞，到气若游丝阴阳相隔，只需要两个月不到的时间。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="坚强"&gt;坚强
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;外公去世时82岁，在我家的四位老人中，恰恰是身体最好的。老两口信了大半辈子的佛，不沾烟酒，每天坚持锻炼。几十年的素食主义生活，近几年才在我妈的劝导下开始吃少量荤菜，多数老年病在他们面前都绕道而行。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;出事之前，我趁着清明回家探望，全家人驾车去南昌近郊爬山。我自己都勉强才能跟上外公的脚步，山路上，除了拍照他一刻没停，率先到达山顶。我手机里还有一张半山腰时拍的照片，外公站在高处向下挥手。他出门喜欢戴帽子，手握帽子的动作也很特别，鸭舌帽在他手上能挥出礼帽的感觉，很像一位睿智的老华侨，目光坚毅有神。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回到杭州不久，听闻外公重病住院，当天就买车票回家。外婆和我讲了来龙去脉，他俩那天还像往常一样出门运动，外婆在一个固定地方舞扇，外公在附近散步。舞扇结束却不见外公回来，找遍了附近街道，才发现外公晕倒在路边，满脸沙土。医院诊断是脑部血管瘤破裂，外公年事已高，手术本身有风险，但如果成功就有希望脱离生命危险。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我亲自推着外公的病床，从重症监护室转移到手术室。他神志还很清醒，声音微弱却坚定地说“我要做手术”。外公向来是个不服输的人，他有这份求生的坚强，我们大家都很安心。只是我没想到，这是我见到他的最后一面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="岁月的镰刀"&gt;岁月的镰刀
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;手术很成功，破裂的血管瘤顺利堵上了。外公最终是死于肺部感染等手术并发症。术后一个多月内，情况还曾经好转过，突然的一次恶化终究还是带走了他。就像医生所说：“无论他平时身体有多好，80多岁的肺，能好到哪里去？”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;听我妈说，外公是在痛苦中离去的。有一天他要张口说话，我妈凑过去听，外公只是无力地吐出两个字：“想死”。听到此处，心中难过无以言表。只希望他在临走一刻，对自己的一生感到满意，对家庭和子女感到欣慰。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;逝者往矣，我妈第二天就把后事办完了，供养在一座寺庙里。我没来得及见外公最后一面。我家没有任何丧葬风俗，也不信死者为大，眼下最重要的是照顾和开导外婆。直到我最近再见到她们，消瘦程度真是触目惊心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有天夜里，我又重新看了一遍当时清明爬山的音乐相册，这是我妈精心制作的。此时再打开看，心情完全不同。外公红润的面容如今已是遗像，外婆则阴郁了不少，我妈经过这近两个月的奔波已经瘦了一大圈。照片一张张切换，有单人照也有合影，末尾还有一张山顶的全家福。我妈选了《相亲相爱一家人》作为背景音乐，是个群星版本，一人一句，音色各不相同。其中有些人的声音听起来不是很专业，或许不是歌手，而是演员主持什么的。有趣的是，这样听起来反倒更有真实感，像是一家人围炉夜话，你一言我一语。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="一家人"&gt;一家人
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;我好多次打电话说要再回家一趟，虽然最后一面已经见不着了，我特别想探望一下外婆。我妈让我别去，我这边新房装修各种问题也走不开，她说有更好的方案。于是一家人驱车来杭州，要来我的出租屋里住几天。换个居住环境，对外婆的情绪有更大的帮助，我妈也借此机会休假，好好放松一下。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;确实是个好主意，虽然路途上要辛苦一下。我马上就去准备了席子枕头，也添置了碗碟、筷子、拖鞋和一些生活用品。他们从南昌带了一些菜来，花菜、青椒、番茄，留在家里会坏，可惜了，索性带过来吃掉。稀松平常的细节，却让人倍感温馨，就像在自己家里一样，真好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;安顿他们住下，换个地方过几天平凡日子，外婆见到我很高兴，没有之前那么低落了。其实我刚搬来这个出租屋也没几天，新租的房子。这里有个开放式大阳台，望出去是一个公园，里面有山有寺庙。即使7月中旬，夜晚阳台也不热。一家人坐在晚风中吃西瓜，拉家常。像极了我小时候，从前在外婆家也是这么过的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;带他们参观我即将装修完成的新家，大家提了一些建议，共同畅想了一下我未来的生活。我说等新家能住人了，外婆可以长期来我这度假。以后我要有一辆车，他们来我这里住时，我带全家人上高速一路向西，临安一带好玩的可多了。外婆笑起来还像以前那样灿烂，眼睛会眯成一条缝。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;休假一周很快，我妈也要赶回南昌上班了。我说，要不然让外婆就留下来和我先住出租屋呗，这里条件也很好啊。我妈说你有这份心就行了，外公谁也替代不了，我们再多陪伴也取代不了那个位置。外婆需要一种新的生活，光有家人的帮助还不够，她还需要朋友。从前一起舞扇的老太太们都在南昌，她会鼓励外婆多出去和朋友活动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，他们又驱车上路了，出租屋变回了之前的模样。可总感觉又有点不一样，少了点什么，也多了点什么。前几天里那种平凡的美好散去了，令人无比怀念。同时又意识到手里多了一根线，另一头牵着他们，我似乎能感觉到线的另一头在高速公路上移动。无论距离几何，都能握住彼此传来的温度，这就是一家人。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>神龙帕夫</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3504/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2016 20:46:14 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3504/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;天气热起来了，免不了有些浮躁。最近有一首老歌令我着迷，总能让我仿佛置身初夏夜晚，四周除了轻风，只有明澈星空与无垠旷野。星空下的少年回到了意识的起点，对整个世界充满好奇：我在哪里？天边有什么？头顶那些亮闪闪的是什么？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://music.163.com/#/song?id=2004011" target="_blank"&gt;Puff the magic dragon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这首歌还有许多其他版本，我觉得唯有四兄弟的和声唱出了这种感觉。原以为歌词会与旋律一样欢乐轻松，看了才发现是个有些揪心的故事，尤其在结尾处的转折。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;它很像去年的动画电影《头脑特工队》。里面那只魔幻生物——彩虹象bing-bong，身体是粉色的棉花糖，驾驶着彩虹车帮助Joy返回指挥部。想起bing-bong最终消散在遗忘深渊的那一幕，我觉得或许应该介绍他与神龙帕夫认识，他们肯定一见如故。我甚至能想象他们俩尽情欢笑，打一场魔法的雪仗，世界瞬间五彩斑斓。然后他们玩累了，彩云飘散，光芒熄灭。bing-bong和神龙帕夫收起笑容，相视无言。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我已经记不起童年有没有过这样的伙伴。可能我不是一个有想象力的上帝，没有创造出如此神奇的世界。也可能他们走向了相同的命运，永远留在了记忆的迷宫里。据我妈讲，我小时候特别喜欢玩具小汽车，比巴掌小一些，不握在手里不肯睡觉。但我的小汽车总会莫名其妙不见，然后只好再买新的。直到搬新家，我妈才发现衣柜后面变成了停车场。这算是我童年做过的一件坏事了，我也想不通动机何在，只是玩腻的话应该不至于如此，而且我也从没这样对待过其他玩具。我猜想，可能那时经常上演某种剧本，比如新的汽车侠打败了它堕入邪道的师傅之类。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;过去这么久了，还是会被如今小孩的某些举动深深震撼。我目前租住的小区附近，有一所实验小学。偶尔目睹这些天真烂漫的面孔放学回家，他们一手牵着妈妈，一手拿着甜筒，还要在石板路上跳来跳去。我凑近一些，跟在他们后面，我发现这个小男孩并不是在石板路上乱跳。一路上的石板色泽不同，有深有浅。他每一次落脚，都一定要踩在颜色较深的石板上。甚至跳到某处，前方路上没有深色石板了，小男孩拉住了妈妈，站着犹豫了片刻，然后有些不甘心地恢复了正常的走路姿态。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我不知道现在的小孩玩些什么游戏，如果换作以前的我这么跳，或许我正在玩3D版魂斗罗。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想起毕业的第一份工作，那年冬天积雪深到脚踝，对于杭州来说，这非常难得。工作到下午3点多，部门主管忽然兴起，发动我们一帮人下楼去打雪仗。吭哧吭哧来到楼下的广场，阳光斜照在脸上、手上，不过一点温度也没有。我们那位爱玩的运营同学，首先抄起一个大雪球向主管扔去，主管也马上还击。大伙分成了两拨，稀稀拉拉互扔了一会儿，决定开始堆雪人。也有人和我一样，蜷在羽绒服里，伸手摸一摸雪，然后马上缩回去，活像一只蛏子。我只记得自己象征性地捏了两个雪球，扔向了路边的禁止停车标牌。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;原来雪也有同样的命运。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2016-05/05-23/2ad60013caec42975fd880f7671bf0a2.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;找了很长时间，终于翻出这张老图，尽管这出自一位成年漫画家之手。2009年的作品，真实得令我过目不忘。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有时看到小孩从路边拾起一根树枝，凌空胡乱挥舞，自己还左躲右闪。真是不敢想象他眼中的画面有多么惊险，或者潇洒。遗憾的是，还能保留这样异想世界的成年人，已经少之又少了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我已经好几年没有再做过那些离奇的梦，博客的梦境栏目不知道是不是就此无限期停播了。神龙帕夫可能早已离我们而去，如果还能感受到他的存在，请当作亲人一样珍惜。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>看房要点</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3492/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 00:45:26 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3492/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;前阵子朋友买房，找我陪同看房去。不过当时太忙没抽出时间，就依我自己的经验和教训，写了个简单的选房要点给他。发现还是值得分享给大家的，尤其对于毫无经验的朋友，提供了一个大致脉络。不算全面，可以按此思路自行补充。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="从大到小先看板块"&gt;从大到小，先看板块
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;板块交通如何，现在和以后有没有地铁，去最近的商业区道路堵不堵。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;周边有些什么基础设施，医院、学校、大型超市、商业广场有没有。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;发展的余地大不大，是成熟的老城区，还是一片荒地？周边设施如果不完善，但有足够多的可开发空地也不错。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;板块所在的行政区是否还有向外发展的潜力，如果四面都是成熟地区，未来无法再继续吞并郊区扩大版图，那地价很可能会虚高。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;附近有没有影响生活质量的设施，例如高架桥、火葬场、垃圾焚烧厂等。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;户口问题，要看板块所属行政区。有些城市会有差别对待的现象，比如余杭和萧山区的户口和杭州主城区就有区别，以后自己落户、子女读书都会有影响。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="缩小一点楼盘及周边"&gt;缩小一点，楼盘及周边
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;和相邻几个楼盘的差价大不大，如果高很多，通常是有它积极的原因，不妨详细了解下，有可能物有所值。低很多就要谨慎了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;开发商口碑如何，名声较好的全国性开发商在项目经验上的确有一定优势，价格也通常比其他同地段楼盘高，大约能高到20%-100%。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;两个楼盘虽然相邻，但是可能因为楼盘档次不同，工程质量就会相差很多，甚至同一个开发商也会出现这种差别对待。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;如果一片区域内的楼盘都是同一个开发商，那有可能是好现象。有实力的开发商拿下一大片地，会全局规划，整个设计成一座小型城市，小小一片区域就能解决大部分的生活需求。可以重点询问一下配套设施。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="楼盘内部"&gt;楼盘内部
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;看容积率、楼间距，这两个指标其实都能反映小区内的开阔程度。小区内部拥挤的话，低层很难晒到太阳，采光也会差。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;如果楼盘之前已经交付了一批，可以去实地体验下工程质量，走访已经入住的邻居。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;看楼盘前几期的入住率怎么样，卖出去多久了，是不是快住满了。如果开售很长时间都没什么人买，周围却卖得火热，那一定有你没注意到的弊端，市场是用脚投票的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;一层楼至少要有两部电梯，否则坏了就要爬楼。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;小区内地面区域能不能开车，不能是最好的，不会导致行人不便，也更放心老人小孩活动。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;有没有一些能够提升生活体验的设施，游泳池、球场、健身房等，这些是加分项。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="选楼"&gt;选楼
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;选楼尽量避开高架和繁忙的马路。当然，那个位置的房子也会相对便宜点。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;小区如果特别大，或者呈长条形，要考虑步行到小区大门的距离，不能忽略乘坐公交出行的可能性。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;广场舞问题，如果你买5层以下的话，要选一栋附近没有开阔地的楼，有广场就可能有广场舞。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;个别小区建在坡地上，不同楼的地下车库情况不同。一些楼从地下车库到电梯之间一马平川，另一些从地下车库到电梯却要上台阶。这对于将来入住搬运重物是一大考验，拖车就派不上用场了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;小区附近有学校当然好，但是太近了也会是一种干扰。想象一下，你休假在家，想睡个懒觉，早晨7点半窗外高音喇叭唱起了运动员进行曲。同理，楼下如有大片公共草坪也要慎重，清晨的割草机，你能明白。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="最后选户型"&gt;最后，选户型
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;户型要考虑的地方最多，首先要了解几个面积方面的概念：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公摊面积：电梯间、水表箱等公共区域 / 每层户数
赠送面积：销售人员会告诉你哪些是赠送面积，通常是阳台、飘窗等
建筑面积：使用面积 + 公摊面积 - 赠送面积
使用面积：这才是真正对你有意义的面积，你的各个房间加上你家墙壁所占的面积&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开发商宣传材料上的面积通常指建筑面积，注意，物业费等大部分费用，都是按建筑面积来算。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;看样板间的时候要忽略窗帘、桌椅等漂亮的软装，这些再漂亮也不是户型的功劳。要看那些不能改动的东西，比如阳台窗户的大小、承重墙的位置（这个在户型图上会标出来），承重墙太多，以后装修改造的余地就很小。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在面积近似的情况下，边套总是比中间套贵。边套多一面采光，能贵到10%-30%。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;主卧必须朝南，次卧和阳台也至少要有一个朝南。不要有暗房，即使是厕所，也要能看到自然光。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;户型要方正，各个房间最好都是矩形。缺个角或者突出一截承重墙就不好了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;注意原始户型的阳台，主阳台在卧室里其实是不方便的，因为这是家庭的公用区域，却要穿过一个私密区域。阳台朝西或者朝南最好。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;中小户型的厨房一般是个长方形，厨房门如果开在长边上，内部空间就比较好设计，U型厨房空间利用率也高。如果门开在短边上，很可能只能做L型厨房，收纳能力大大降低。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;看样板房时，注意观察和询问油烟机的摆放朝向，与公共烟道朝向是否一致。要保证将来的抽油烟效果好，油烟机就不能离公共烟道太远。开发商的原始户型不一定会考虑这一点，为了样板间的美观，可能会导致中间的烟管过长。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;要考虑空调外机的摆放问题，样板间一般都不考虑这种问题，只顾装饰得好看，都是按中央空调来设计的。但如果你每个房间都装独立的空调，就需要大量空调外机，研究一下户型里有没有地方能放下这些外机，否则最终就会侵占你的使用面积。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;注意赠送面积的问题。赠送的面积通常在交房的时候都是空的，整栋楼从顶上直通到底，或者是飘窗的形式。交房一段时间后，这些地方的浇筑是开发商来做，还是要自己花钱做？而且这种浇筑区域通常都做不了地漏，如果要把赠送面积当成主阳台用，就要面对阳台不能摆洗衣机的问题。洗衣机放在卫生间里就不方便了，而且影响洗衣机寿命。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;有些房子是错层式的，奇数层和偶数层的户型有点细微差别。问问有没有这样的情况，区别是什么。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我只有过一次购房经历，暂时只能考虑到这些。不管怎样，希望对即将出手的你有所启发。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Expectations and Determination in Life</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3454/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 23:34:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post-en/3454/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We all lead different lives – some constrained, some challenging, some luxurious, others simple. Even in &lt;em&gt;The Truman Show&lt;/em&gt;, a fabricated life is still a life. Everyone has one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much determination do you need to live the life you want? It&amp;rsquo;s a tricky question, difficult to measure. I came up with a visual analogy, though. Remember those liquid density experiments from middle school?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2015-08/08-03/1.png"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a U-shaped tube. Orange liquid represents your life expectations; blue represents determination. The orange liquid&amp;rsquo;s density shows how clearly you see your ideal life. The blue&amp;rsquo;s density is your drive. A float separates the liquids. When balanced, it rests at the bottom. If it shifts left, negativity prevails; right, positivity prevails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Here are some scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low expectations, low determination: The float stays put. You&amp;rsquo;ll likely have a peaceful life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High expectations, strong will, hard work: Equilibrium. You earned it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envy others, feeling it&amp;rsquo;s out of reach: Float shifts left. You&amp;rsquo;ll likely be stuck, blaming the world, full of negativity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aiming too high, lacking skills: Blue liquid&amp;rsquo;s too light, float shifts left. You&amp;rsquo;ll be spinning your wheels, feeling sorry for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idealizing, seeing only the good: Orange liquid&amp;rsquo;s too dense, float shifts left. Life will seem harsh; you might get discouraged and lose your way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking simplicity, but believing in better: Float shifts right. You&amp;rsquo;ll sense life&amp;rsquo;s richness and excitement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modest goals, no strong will, but taking small steps: Blue liquid&amp;rsquo;s dense, float shifts right. Your rewards may exceed expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an extreme, like in &lt;em&gt;Trainspotting&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;I choose not to choose.&amp;rdquo; Complete spontaneity, no plans, no goals. No responsibility. This kind of aimless life needs zero determination, zero expectations. The U-tube is empty; the float&amp;rsquo;s balanced. Avoid this balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, there&amp;rsquo;s no opposite extreme. Desires and drive vary greatly. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s U-tube is different. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes the world diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s useful for self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a workaholic. No job, not even entrepreneurship, has ever consumed me entirely. I always reserve time – sacred time – for friends, sleep, reading, writing, or simply relaxing and daydreaming. Nothing else really captivates me, so my expectations aren&amp;rsquo;t high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ideal life? A comfortable home, ample free time, a few close friends. And, like now, a relaxed pace. Satisfying my curiosity, becoming a knowledgeable person. This seemingly inexpensive life actually requires a solid financial base, which I lack. But money isn&amp;rsquo;t the core issue; there&amp;rsquo;s a way to live at any level. At least the goal is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to be inert. My resolve isn&amp;rsquo;t that strong. My current life isn&amp;rsquo;t threatened, so where&amp;rsquo;s the urgency? If a crisis hits, and life gets hard, I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll find the will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding drive, I have some strengths. I&amp;rsquo;m decisive on small matters. I might not be fully prepared, but I&amp;rsquo;m quick. For big decisions, I don&amp;rsquo;t get lost in details and rarely second-guess myself. I&amp;rsquo;m good at turning ideas into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, since I&amp;rsquo;m generally happy, my U-tube would show: both sides low, blue slightly denser, float a bit to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I content with that? Hmm&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>生活的期望与决心</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3454/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 23:34:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3454/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;压抑茫然、落魄挣扎、纸醉金迷、淡泊处世，各式各样的生活。即便是楚门的世界，虚假也未尝不是一种生活。人人都活在其中，绝无例外。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;让自己过上怎样的生活，需要多大的决心？这个问题很抽象，无法衡量。不过我想到了一种相对形象的表现形式。大家是否还记得中学物理的液体密度实验？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2015-08/08-03/1.png"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大致就是这样一个U形管。橙色液体是你对生活的期望，蓝色液体是你对生活的决心。橙色液体的密度，是你对理想生活的认知程度。蓝色液体的密度，是你的行动力。底部有一个活动的浮标，将左右液体相互隔绝。平衡状态下，浮标处于U形管底端。浮标左移，负能量占主导；浮标右移，正能量占主导。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;什么意思？简单举几个例：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对生活期望不高，也下不了多大的决心，浮标会停留在平衡位置。你会过上平静的生活。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对生活的期望很高，同时意志坚定，努力经营，也能达到平衡点。那是你应得的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;憧憬别人的生活，同时又觉得那与自己无缘，浮标左移。你会长期处于压抑消沉的状态，埋怨社会，负能量满满。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;好高骛远，眼高手低，蓝色液体密度太小，浮标左移。你会原地打转，自怨自艾。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;过于理想化，只看见别人生活光鲜的一面，橙色液体密度太大，浮标左移。你会发现生活不易，随之泄气、挫败、迷失方向。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;追求简单朴实的生活，同时对美好生活抱有坚定信念，浮标右移。你会感受到生活的丰富与精彩。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;没什么追求，也下不了决心，但想到什么就去做，一点一滴改善。蓝色液体密度高，浮标右移。你会发现收获总是超出预期。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里有一种极端情况，像《猜火车》那样：I choose not to choose。完全随性而为，没有计划，没有目标。不对任何人负责，包括自己。这种烂泥般的生活，不需要丝毫的决心，对生活也不抱任何期望。U形管两头都是空的，浮标处于平衡状态。这样的平衡，自然是要敬而远之的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;与之相对，却找不到另一个极端。人们追求的东西五花八门，追求的决心与行动力也参差不齐。每个人的U型管都是独一无二的图形。正是如此，世界才这般丰富多彩。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;既然模型已经建立，虽然不算严谨，也足够用来自我分析了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我并不是工作狂，从来没有一份工作能让我投入100%的精力，即使是创业。我总会留出一定比例的时间，这些时间神圣不可侵犯。用来朋友聚会、睡懒觉、看闲书、写写东西，或者纯粹打发时间、胡思乱想。似乎也没有什么比这更吸引我的了，对生活期望不算高。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;理想的生活是什么样子？有干净舒适的住处，充足的业余时间，一小撮稳定可靠的朋友。然后还像现在这样，闲散度日。用各种方法满足好奇心，做个学识渊博的人。其实这种看似低成本的生活，需要强大的经济基础来支撑，以我目前的实力，是不足以长期维持下去的。不过钱从来不是问题，什么水平都有相应的活法，至少目标是明确的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同时，由于懒散惯了，我很容易安于现状。对理想生活的决心，好像也不怎么强烈。因为眼下的生活状态，并没有受到多大的威胁，斗志又从何而来呢？假如某天出现重大变故，生活压力剧增。但愿那时我会有坚定的意志吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;至于行动力，还是有些优势的。小事情上做决策，我极少瞻前顾后。虽然经常因为准备不足导致一些麻烦，至少行动还是迅速的。重大事件，我不会拘泥于细枝末节，也极少质疑已经做的决定。想法比较能付诸实施。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，鉴于还是开心时刻居多，可以大致画出自己的图形：两边水位都不高，蓝色液体密度略大，浮标偏右。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这样的结果，我满意吗？嗯……我不知道。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>这也是一种常态</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3452/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2015 22:25:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3452/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;终于搬家了，之前的出租屋环境实在恶劣，想到我居然住满了一年，真是有点不可思议。随着年龄和经历的增长，在不知不觉中，人也会变得更容易妥协。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;找房子从来不是什么愉快的事情。中介在网上挂2000每月，打电话过去对方说现在要4000了，不过这里有些其他的房子你要不要来看看？这种招揽生意的方式由来已久，不知是杭州特色还是行业惯例。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一带发展相对成熟，个人房东几乎绝迹了，任何渠道无一例外都是中介。老小区的条件实在不敢恭维，余下那些高档单身公寓华而不实，不是用来过日子的。我要找的，恰恰在这个巨大断档中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最终决定改变策略，租了一套老小区的2室1厅，再招个室友合租。签约后，暴露出许多问题。有房子的，也有我自己的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;此前看过几套奇差无比的房子，大铁盘子钨丝灯、推拉窗遍布铁锈，恍如穿越回了文革时期。对比之下，感觉这里重回了现实，印象分大增。一高兴，走马观花看了一圈，当场就租了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;住进来发现这整个就是一片雷区，问题都藏得很深：家电迟迟不到位，入住一个星期后才陆续进场。窗帘居然用的是夹子，一拉整块布就掉下来了。在这里还有幸见到了古老的半自动洗衣机，加水按一下，漂洗再去按一下，脱水还得按一下。卧室墙上本来有个孔走空调管线，却非得从窗户进来，永远关不上的窗户就成了蚊虫的传送门。卫生间的格局更诡异，唯一的地漏在淋浴房里，唯一的洗衣机进水口也在淋浴房里。淋浴房偏偏又往外漏水，每天都要上演精卫填海。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为此来回折腾了一个星期，若说没有负能量也是不可能的。内心几度斯巴达，心想自己这么还在过着这种日子。相信但凡对生活有些追求的人，都有过这样的时刻。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，我绝不会在此倒苦水，我想讲的是逆转的故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;周五下班，在公交站等车。晚高峰人潮行色匆匆，在炽热的地面四散流窜。头顶上有些晃动的身影吸引我注意，那是盘旋在路灯下的蝙蝠。蝙蝠的飞行方式很特别，虽然达不到鸟类的速度，却灵活善变。看着这些剪影急转急停、上下翻飞，感觉像空气分子在高温下游离，有一种很强的催眠作用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于整个画面没有视觉中心，我尝试把手指放在眼前，让背景失去焦点。蝙蝠的剪影模糊成了一团，路灯的光晕在后方扩散。我这才注意到美丽的晚霞，纯净无暇。就这样凝视夜空，看天色由柔和的蓝紫橙渐变，转为墨蓝色的星盘。这个过程当然比我说的漫长许多。也恰恰因此有一种庄严的仪式感，似乎在昭示万物运转的规律，让人内心极度平静安详。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就是这样一幅再日常不过的仲夏夜景，竟能让人重新振作。我在想，如果哪天诞生了具备人类情绪的人工智能，他也绝对无法理解这样的思维转变。这使我想起09版钢炼，爱德华两兄弟在荒岛上悟出了炼金术的真谛——世界周而复始的运转，本身就是一切动力的源泉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;生活也当如此。诸多的不顺与困难，物质上的，或是精神上的，必然有其合乎逻辑的成因。区别在于，物质上的困难，发生了就不会再改变，就只有那么多。会增加的只是精神负担。这些微不足道的飞絮积累到一定程度，也足够将人压垮。然而飞絮终归是轻飘飘的东西，挥之即去。清风拂过，一切释然。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这回搬家，本是为了更好的居住环境，急迫与松懈却让自己跳进了另一个坑。这种落差是影响情绪的主因。然而，这段时间的努力与奔波，不正是在逐个解决问题么。截止今天，多数麻烦都已迎刃而解。再重新审视一番，结果终于达到了预期。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;遭遇困难，不开心；解决困难，找回快乐。世界就是如此在运转着，简单却有效。这也是一种常态，接受或抗争，都是合理的选择。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>一碗方便面的释怀</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3432/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 20:52:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3432/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;宇宙间有一个终极问题，今晚吃什么。做饭的人需要思考买什么菜，不做饭的人需要思考下哪家馆子。不巧这两种我都体验过，都不是省油的灯。若非监狱里这种被剥夺了选择权力的情况，此题基本无解。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在住的出租屋没法做饭，每天在楼下解决。砂锅太咸，炒菜太慢，快餐太油，水饺太单调。最后走进了超市，一盒泡面、一包豆腐干，恍然大悟这才是最佳解决方案。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拆开包装，等待电水壶里咕嘟咕嘟翻腾。有那么一瞬间，无数个时间点仿佛重合了。高中时代，妈妈变着花样准备早餐，偶尔会煮泡面。一碗上桌，夸张的香味透着温暖。大学的周末，寝室集体备好干粮。一局游戏结束，大伙儿在饮水机前排队泡面的盛况仍然历历在目。鸡腿、香肠、辣条、豆腐干，没有点配菜总觉得少了那么点意思。毕业后，有几次深夜加班。无论心中是否有怨气，泡面的腾腾热气总能让眼前画面产生奇妙的变化。透过水蒸气，似乎世界变得可爱了一些。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;食物总是美好的东西，即使是最不讲究的方便面。上周末重温了一遍料理鼠王，那位美食评论家品尝杂烩菜时，或许就是这种感受。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2015-03/03-27/2.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天买的是干拌面，吃法很有意思。不像普通泡面那样，佐料一股脑倒下去，冲水就是。干拌面要先把纸盖掀开一角，取出菜料包和酱料包，直接倒水进去。再把酱料包放在盖子上，让蒸汽的温度使它软化解冻。几分钟过后，掀开与之相对的另一个角，开一个小口倒掉热水，留下干面。最后才把菜料包和酱料包倒出来拌进面里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大学时第一次吃这种面，当时就觉得整个过程相当讲究，今天仍然如此。虽说它终究只是方便面，所谓的讲究也多少有点一厢情愿。但这种仪式感还是很有趣的，会让人在掰开一次性筷子的时候，不由自主想要说一句我开动啦。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这应该就是食物之所以美好的原因之一吧。越简单的食物，往往越能激发某种特殊感情。记得《东京朋友》里，酒馆老板给真希端上的那碗素面，当中摆着一颗去皮的水煮番茄，简单而温馨，生活的困顿一扫而空。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2015-03/03-27/1.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;眼前这碗干拌面，似乎也有同样的魔力。都说一个人如果开始频繁怀念过去，那他一定对目前的生活不满意。当下的艰难，需要通过从前的美好来调剂，这是很有道理的。确实，不顺利近来频频发生。竹子开玩笑说，我遇到了中年危机，要小心谨慎不能打碎了我的玻璃心。这说法很好玩，我一听就乐了。26岁的中年危机，荒谬至极的说法，和危机本身一样荒谬。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;酱料包拌得不够匀，一口咸一口淡，就像生活的波澜起伏。相比泡面，干拌面口感筋道许多。面条更细，却更坚韧。这是它的职业素养。吃着这样的面，跟随欢快的音乐频频点头。卑微平凡的乐趣，一样会使人豁然开朗。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一碗干拌面，轻松化解了一切，重重困阻烟消云散。只要生活与理想的永动机持续运转，释怀，就是一瞬间的事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，分享一下这首欢快的音乐。歌名很切题，&lt;a class="link" href="http://music.163.com/#/song?id=27566253" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Devil In My Hand&lt;/a&gt;，一切都由你。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>城市的记忆</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3425/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 23:49:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3425/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! 我终于回来了。日志荒废了很久，在此向大家透露一点规律。如果我有很长一段时间只发翻译，不写文章了，有两种可能：要么是沉迷游戏，要么在忙着做私单。这次是后者。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除夕前一天把设计资料都交付了。忽然空闲下来的感觉很奇特，似乎只愿意挥霍时间，去探究一些平日里不太关心的事情，比如春节。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实际上我对春节向来没什么感觉。回到自己长大的城市，与家人朋友团聚。这就是春节的本质。与此相比，春联、鞭炮那些文化符号就没什么分量，对我而言也没多大意义。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;朋友聚会，见到了从新加坡赶回来的螃蟹同学，章鱼也带着法国男友从北京回到南昌。这些事实都在证明着，每年一次的大迁徙一定有它的重大意义。为的就是留存在这座城市里的记忆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;几个朋友在咖啡馆中闲聊，菜单末尾的一张南昌府治图引起我的兴趣。由于光线昏暗影响拍摄效果，我从网上找了一个更清晰的版本。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2015-02/02-21/1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这些地名我听了20多年，其中一些今天看来没有任何意义。比如百花洲，今天是中山路商业街的一段，附近有一座商场。东湖仍然留存到了今天，以人工湖的形式翻新重生，变成了一座公园。古南昌的各个城门，如今都作为地名沿用了下来，城市的扩张进程忽然就有了画面感。万寿宫、康王庙、建德观，这些算是保存最完好的地名，一个字都没有变过，虽然那些宫、庙、观早已不知所踪。所有这些，都让人不禁想象一座城的漫长历史，还有其背后的故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;生活大爆炸有场戏我印象很深。Sheldon问Penny，全国最多的路名是什么。没等Penny回答，他就抢着说是2nd Street，我猜你肯定要说1st Street，但多数时候它们有其他的名字，比如Main Street。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这不仅仅是笑料。判断一座城市的格局，路名很有参考意义。比如杭州滨江区的路名是这样的：滨盛路、滨文路、滨兴路……从这些工整的现代名称，可以看出这片城区比较年轻。地名经过了系统的规划，人工痕迹明显。下沙高教园从前甚至都还没有正经的路名：2号大街、4号大街、6号大街。后来它们有了名字：学林街、学府街、文海路、文汇路，它传达出的信息也是相当明确的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在杭州的灵隐一带，有一个地方叫做“立马回头”。这个颇具诗意的名称背后是有文化渊源的。有些是历史，有的则是传说。无论真实与否，这就是城市的记忆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;南昌城作为古代楚地较早发展起来的城市，也有相当的文化底蕴。汉朝将军灌婴驻扎此地，建立起南昌城的雏形。这个名称，就是意在使南方兴旺昌盛。直至今天，还有些路名在透露着南昌的过往。永叔路是为了纪念欧阳修，船山路则是为了纪念明末思想家王船山。这两条路首尾相连，附近并没有相应的纪念设施，路名八成是后人安上去的。尽管只剩下少数地名，城市历史也没有得到很好的保存，但还是能看出南昌人民为此付出了努力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;城有城的记忆，人也有人的记忆。南昌在向外高速扩张，与此同时老城区的现代化就非常缓慢，许多承载我从前记忆的地点都得以保存。读过的学校、骑车经过的桥、逛过的公园，好像一点也没变，只是蒙了一层复古滤镜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有些地方十年如一日，有的地方却是沧海桑田。我拥有的第一张银行卡，少年时代家里人给办的。招商银行，八一大道永叔路口。这个支行后来消失了很长一段时间。十多年间那个位置风云变幻，出现过酒店、快餐店、新华书店，我的自然科学启蒙读物《少年儿童百科全书》还是在那家店买的。小时候这里甚至出现过一家供销社，这个名词可是很久没想起过了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;时隔10多年，相同地点，我在一家新的招商银行里把这张卡给销户了。它经历了神奇而圆满的一生。像《大鱼》里的那位父亲，游历天南海北，最终归乡长眠。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;南昌不大，直到今天也还是座小城市。历数我搬家、升学的轨迹，覆盖的范围更是不到城市的10%。生活过的场景如今还时常出现在梦境中。这些不带感情色彩的地点与场景，构成了我的记忆。人的记忆汇集起来，又构成了城市的记忆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;城市的记忆，其实就是家的意义。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>修车匠</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3411/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2014 13:47:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3411/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;前两天头疼眼睛疼，在家休养没去上班。不过这毛病不影响其他活动，只是看不了屏幕。索性趁这机会去修一修我闲置了半年的自行车。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这车一年前在网上买的，寄过来龙头、后轮、踏板等几个大件还是我自己照说明书装的。很明显当时没装好，骑了没多久，刹车不灵，座椅松动，链条也断了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;话说，现在要在城市里找个修自行车的地方很不容易。在杭州换过好几个住处，每次要修自行车，都是一路问进了城中村。在这些恍如隔世的地方，藏着各种各样的手艺人。修车、开锁、裁缝、补锅，别处都找不着。小时候老家街头经常会听到这样的吆喝：“磨剪子嘞，锵菜刀！”，这里也是他们最后的阵地。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;果然，一路打听，好心的村民们给我指路到了城中村里的一个犄角旮旯。旁边还是大马路，能看得见马路对面的现代建筑，路边停着一排工程车。仅仅一墙之隔，就是拆迁留下的残垣断壁，还有水塔这样的老古董。有根电线杆垂下一大捆线路，盘根错节如藤蔓一般，就是这里了。一座极其简陋的小棚屋，招牌上的文字口语化得很接地气：“修车子”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;修车师傅是个老大爷，北方口音，具体哪里我也分辨不出来。我到的时候，他正在和一个村民讨论水管结冰的事情。村民说他家水表露在外面容易冻住，一冻家里就停水。大爷从满地的扳手螺丝中抬起头来，说你把椅子后面那件旧衣服拿去，把水管包起来。说完憨厚一笑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;送走上一个顾客，他直起腰板，走到我的车面前。我说师傅帮我看看呗，我这车好多毛病，刹车不灵，链条也断了。大爷又是呵呵一笑，原来他真是自来熟，和谁都这样。“好嘞！”，然后动手把我的车翻过来。看到链条的断裂处，他啧啧摇头，“这链条不行”。大爷的语气很有意思，我不知道这样形容准不准确，那就像是一名老师在评价他不争气的学生。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“帮我换一条吧，它没救了，我自己接回去好几次了。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“你看我这条”，大爷拿出一副新链条，洋洋得意，“比你这条结实多了。”为了证明这点，他特地把两条链子的厚度对比给我看。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“小伙子你是在上班还是上学啊？”他一边修一边找我聊天。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“我已经上班了。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“在哪里工作？”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“蒋村那边，我住在这附近。现在修个自行车太难找了，一路问过来才找到你这儿。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“别人都去修电瓶车了，我老啦，嘿嘿，只懂这玩意。”大爷摇着踏板，新链条开始一节节咬合在大齿轮上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“哟！难怪你说刹车不灵。”大爷忽然像发现了新大陆，“你后轮的刹车根本就没了嘛！呐，你看，刹车片都不知道哪去了！哈哈哈哈……”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我也跟着一起笑。虽然这本身没有多好笑，不过看得出来大爷是真乐了。看他笑得那么毫无保留，忽然我也乐了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这时过来个大姐，她那辆车的支架坏了，车只能平着放。大爷手里还在拆我的车后轮，侧过头去看了一眼，说这个支架的弹簧坏了，修也只能维持一阵子，你看看是要修还是换一个。大姐说不能完全修好吗？我这车你别看它破，还真经用，买来就从来没修过。大爷起身去那边检查了一下，最终认定这个支架还是修不了了。他用扳手敲了敲弹簧说，你看这已经没有弹性了。于是大姐最终同意换支架。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“你是不是要先修那边啊？”大姐指着我的车问。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大爷特意我和打了声招呼，说那边快，他马上换好继续帮我修。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“小伙子你是做什么工作的？”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我犹豫了一下，考虑要怎么解释我的工作，最后还是选了个最简单的办法：“我是做电脑方面的工作。”我伸出双手比划了一个敲键盘的动作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“可不简单呐！”大爷一下子来劲了，“每个月赚的肯定都不止300了吧？”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我真没想到差距有这么大，好一会儿都以为自己听错了。忽然就不太好意思吐露实情：“嘿嘿，那可能不止，还要多一些。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“我亲戚家一个侄女，本科毕业了，也做的是电脑方面的工作。前阵子加过一次工资，每个月能有3000多了，啧啧。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里我撒了个谎：“很不错啊，这已经有中等水平了，我差不多也这些。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;事后想想这个谎撒得很没有必要，我也没有权力决定别人应该知道什么。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“嘿！你这车真邪了。你看，后轮的钢珠全没了，一个也不剩。”大爷的注意力又回到车上。他翻出一罐钢珠，抹上油，两个两个地往轮轴处填。他举起后轮轴给我看：“没有钢珠，这一截完全磨坏了。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大爷手脚麻利地更换配件，磨平规格不一的连接口：“我修了7年的车，这些都不是问题。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;修理完毕，前后轮打足了气。大爷很得意地拍了拍坐垫，好像这是他的一件得意之作：“好啦，小伙子，试试看！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我试了试，都恢复了正常。付钱的时候多出的5元我让他不用找了，他很开心。嘿嘿一笑，说你这小伙子真不错。然后又仔细地帮我调整了刹车松紧和座椅高度，还拿块布给我把车从上到下都抹了一遍。征得他同意之后，我给他的小店拍了张照。并答应帮他宣传一下，希望住在附近的人都来这里修车。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大爷的“修车子”小铺，地址在西湖区花蒋路上，西溪湿地北边。小店旁有一座标志性的红砖水塔。从水塔下的围墙缺口进去，正面就是大爷的修车小铺。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我做这些其实也没什么目的，就是觉得这位大爷不容易。当然，或许还有一点：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;专注的手艺人，都是值得尊敬的。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>银河的温度</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3410/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 01:09:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/3410/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2014-12/12-01/1.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;《星际穿越》，今年最令我震撼的电影。（内有剧透，慎入）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一直很喜欢太空旅行题材的电影和小说，冰冷深邃的星空，广袤苍凉，令人神往。重重星云背后，是美丽的未知。看到库珀坐在尘土飞扬的自家门前，为人类的裹足不前愤愤不平，我有强烈的共鸣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，这是比较罕见的一类科幻电影，没有对未知世界与未来科技的绚烂想象，也不像《超时空接触》那样重在哲思。故事充满温情，给了荒芜的宇宙一丝温度。库珀的人物设定，引发了最激烈的矛盾冲突。在岌岌可危的人类命运面前，他坚信自己应该是一名开拓者，而非守护者。在内心深处，他只是一名父亲，他说：“父亲不该让自己的孩子感到害怕。”就这样，两个最矛盾的身份交织成了这个美丽的故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;说回电影本身，它毕竟是一部科幻片。光是这方面的成就，就足以令人深深折服。科幻其实是个很暧昧的概念，难以拿捏。拘泥于技术细节，锱铢必较，很可能无法成就一个好故事。科学与现实，很多时候就是如此平淡。太过放纵想象力，脱离了现实，又如何引发共鸣。《星际穿越》选了最平常却最神秘的东西——时间，作为想象的出发点。除此之外，其他都相当谨慎、朴实与克制。在幻想的基础上，用科学的严谨来构筑一砖一瓦，这正是我最欣赏的科幻。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;用心留意，会发现片中的诸多细节相当考究，经得起推敲。略举几处，例如穿越虫洞那场戏。虫洞是只存在于想象中的事物，在科幻电影中有着千奇百怪的形态，多数是一个扁圆的平面或是漩涡状。穿过其中，就到达另一个世界。然而虫洞的性质，是更高维度的空间在三维空间的投射。三维世界中遥遥相望的两个点，在高维度空间中变得触手可及。既然如此，虫洞就应该是个立体形状，由于引力的作用，球形是最合理的形态。片中飞船进入虫洞的方式，不是一头栽进去。而是类似现实中的环绕旋转降落，可见它确实做足了功课。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于宇宙天体的描绘，也可以说相当写实。那颗滔天巨浪的米勒行星的设计就很用心。乍看觉得离谱，整颗行星如此平坦，表面均匀覆盖薄薄一层液态水，哪来那么高的浪。细想其实合理。它是一颗黑洞附近的行星，靠近它的天体在被米勒行星的引力捕获之前，就被黑洞抓住了。这颗孤独的行星完全不受外来物质干扰，稳定的引力与自转产生了平整的球体表面，液态水得以在整个行星地表均匀分布。而1小时=7年的设定，表明这颗行星所处的引力场极其强盛。黑洞引力导致潮汐现象，米勒行星表面的滔天巨浪就是极端的状况。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有更多细节，诸如太空站无声的爆炸、黑洞吸积盘的光晕等等，都比较贴近真实宇宙的状况。然而最妙的，也是最具幻想色彩的部分，就是库珀进入黑洞的那场戏。有理论指出，黑洞内的奇点可能并非真的是一个点。只要黑洞自身在旋转，就有可能从旋转轴方向进入事件视界，而不被撕扯成意大利面。片中的库珀显然是穿过了黑洞的引力场，从白洞返回了太阳系。至于黑洞中的高维空间，虽然幻想成分居多，但也有谨慎考虑，因为虫洞的产生很可能是与黑洞相伴的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;虽然《星际穿越》是部硬派科幻，我觉得它更加无可挑剔的是人物情感的演绎。有个镜头令我当场潸然泪下。记得库珀去寻找神秘坐标，却意外发现NASA的那场戏吗？他本打算独自去的，却发现墨菲藏在副驾驶座的衣服底下。惊讶之余，表现出来的是欣喜。而他与家人做了最后道别，只身前往NASA时，他在途中又掀开了副驾驶座的衣服。这回墨菲没有跟来，舒了一口气的同时，心中略带失落。一个没能好好道别的父亲，内心的痛楚，全在这一掀。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从米勒行星归来，空间站的科学家告诉库珀，他等了23年。虽然早就知道米勒行星上的1小时相当于地球的7年，听到这个结果，仍然有一种突如其来的无力感。三维人类在时间面前多么渺小，23年，沧海桑田。这时候电影院里有不少人笑起来了，可能我太入戏，没发现这23年有什么好笑。紧接着库珀就开始播放这23年来收到的信息，内容越是家常，越让人体会库珀内心的巨大悲伤。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;电影中有一段很妙的蒙太奇。库珀被曼恩袭击，险些丧命。老布兰德也在临终前向墨菲吐露了实情，原来A计划从来没有真正成立过，地球人类被遗弃了。库珀求生的挣扎，墨菲信念的崩塌，在两个遥远的时空完美呼应。父女两人同时陷入低谷，我得承认，这是其中最扣人心弦的一场戏。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;峰回路转，库珀进入高维空间，意外发现墨菲的幽灵就是自己。这里对高维空间的视觉演绎，非常合理而形象。时间实体化这样一个抽象概念，竟然表现得如此精准到位。虽然跨越时间交流的设想，没有那么坚实的依据，但完全不妨碍它成为故事中最美丽的一节。场景和配乐都相当精彩。库珀终于得以向女儿倾诉，墨菲终于理解了父亲。这一刻，他们的世界已经得到拯救。而拯救全人类，则成了顺手而为的小事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;《星际穿越》的故事让我想起两首歌。巧的是，这两首歌刚好对应着墨菲与库珀的两条线。可以说是他们内心情感的绝佳诠释。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;墨菲：&lt;a class="link" href="http://music.163.com/#/song?id=28727863" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Owl City - This Isn&amp;rsquo;t the End&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最近很迷许巍的世外桃源，很有梵音的味道。如果有少数几首歌能让我听一回便怦然心动，这必定是其中之一。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;许巍的其他歌我不怎么听，不是不喜欢，只是觉得自己还没那么超然物外，无法产生足够的共鸣。他独特的音色有种岁月与不羁的感觉，像极了一位饱经风霜的旅者。干涩的嗓音在摇滚乐中爆发出浑厚的力量，震颤心底。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而这一首，除去歌词所表达的美丽向往，还另有一幅景象。它像一剂微苦的汤药，融化了雪山之巅流向大地，途经之处，清澈透亮。一遍遍循环中，我停下所有手中的繁杂和心中的念想，只是静静听着，任凭已融化的思绪，随这一曲悠扬缓缓流淌。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;流过山涧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所有的纷繁与琐碎，构筑了我们眼中的世界，走与停，去与留，像是生命永恒的节拍。行色匆匆，只怕有天忘却自己因何存在，又或是怎样的存在。心无旁骛，去留随风，一片叶或许比我们更懂人生。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;流过鸟鸣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一季花开，一季花落，世界本就是一个巨大的圆，周而复始。被时光深埋与抹去的记忆不计其数。想要向天借一只木匣，表面的年轮清晰可辨。用来珍藏逝去的美好，它独立于时间之外，神秘而永恒。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;流过霞光。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沏一杯淡茶，茶香只弥漫于五步之内。将所有喜悦、感动、苦涩与失落统统揉碎，散落其中，星星点点泛着七彩的微光。一口喝下，身边花鸟鱼虫，都显得如此从容淡泊，豁然开朗。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这首歌中所有的超脱与禅意，都在传递一股生生不息的力量，让人忘却烦恼，心如止水。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;云淡风轻，尘世喧嚣中，它本身就是一曲世外桃源。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>愉快地说再见</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2945/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2013 22:39:14 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2945/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;和朋友一次小聚，收获似乎比近两个月的忙碌工作所得更多。这么说毫不夸张，在彻底被变成一台机器前，它唤醒了我心底某些沉睡已久的东西。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从朋友的婚礼说起，聊过了宗教信仰导致的家庭问题、中国人的宗族意识、两代人的婚姻观差异，也顺便展望了一下朋友们未来可能的去向，顿感人生艰难困苦。平日里那些鸡毛蒜皮的不舒心，简直无法相提并论。不过这不是愤青的批斗大会，一言一语都在触动每个人心底那个最洒脱自由的自己，或许这是我们独有的相互鼓励的方式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;接到电话的那会儿，我应该正对着屏幕在忙些什么，就像这几个月来的每一天。聚会地点在一个半小时车程之外，活动只是吃顿饭而已。不知道为什么，我当下决定扔下一切，即刻启程。心里有场不温不火不痛不痒的小雨，被一道闪电瞬间点燃，划亮了整个夜空。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我有多久没联络过朋友？615的那个纯灌水扯淡群沉寂了多久？愚蠢的人类和小白过得怎么样？远在荷兰的黄鱼还为理想发愁吗？我不知道，我真的不知道。除了每天那些无技术含量的重复劳动，我什么都不知道。幸好，只差一点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;聚会结束乘车回家，公车上一双双倦怠的眼神，每只眼睛里似乎都有自己倒影。路面不平整，车速又忽快忽慢，这条线上晕车是常有的事。走廊对面就有人吐了一地，也弄脏了前面一个妹纸的裤脚。我下意识地掏出纸巾递给晕车者，胳膊没那么长，举了半天却没有人帮我递一下。大家都保持着居高临下的姿态俯视，一部分向那人投去厌恶的眼神，另一部分向我投来疑惑的眼神。倒是那个妹纸接过了纸巾，抽了一张，将其余递给晕车的人，整个过程面部却没有丝毫表情。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这场景太熟悉了，和我在深圳生活那两个月的见闻如出一辙，地铁上、写字楼电梯里，随处可见这样的眼神。我很好奇，他们变得麻木的原因，也和我一样吗？因为机械地工作导致的疲惫，以至于工作与各种琐事在脑海中挥之不去。可是，一张设计稿、一个浏览器兼容性Bug，真的会比咫尺之内一个活生生的人更重要吗？触手可及的距离，反倒成了最远的鸿沟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我也不知道有多久没有注意过身边的事物，直到竹子提醒，我才看到小区草坪落了厚厚一层银杏叶，像心里积了厚厚一层灰尘。甚至我好半天都没反应过来，小区里一直都有银杏树的吗？这对于设计师来说，是很要命的。它意味着我已经脱离了生活，脱离了最神秘的灵感源泉，失去了上帝之眼。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而我的工作内容也有将近60%被前端代码占去，更加无暇顾自己的初衷。这很奇怪，我的前端水平不咋地，仅仅因为团队里只有我会，我就要花一半以上的时间去做自己并不擅长的事情，至少这不符合我的逻辑。时间紧、项目急，我已经开始学会让设计稿缩水了，否则会给我的切图工作带来难题。那么，我究竟在干什么呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我不算挑剔，但对于生活还是讲究的。从前的那么多好习惯，像濒危物种一个个消失。每天坚持吃水果，骑车出门去探索城市的未知角落，看展览，专门花时间收集好音乐，读纸质书，写博客，写小说，锻炼厨艺，早睡……努力回想，竟一个也没剩下。这种程度的失去，已经不是什么东西能够弥补的了。而我需要失去更多，才能把它们一一寻回，不过这确实是我打算做的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，为了朋友、为了设计、也为了生活，是时候愉快地说再见了。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>列车员怎么了！？</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2617/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 01:40:12 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2617/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;坐在火车1号车厢第一排，小小车厢只有4排座位20个人。算上负责的列车员，也就21人，安静得很&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不记得在哪一站上来一家子，买的是站票，阿姨去隔壁车厢找位置了，大叔带着两个8、9岁的女儿在我旁边站着。小女孩精力旺盛，粘着年轻的列车员姐姐团团转，很快聊开了。列车员问小女孩哪里上学，读书辛苦吗，她们的脑袋点得跟触电似的。大叔也凑过来了，告诫她们，知识改变命运，年轻时不辛苦，长大就要辛苦了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;知识改变命运&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;接下来话题就开始围绕这句话打转了，列车员说这个观点在如今这个时代，已经不那么重要了，她如果有小孩，最希望他们健康快乐地成长。大叔摇头，不以为然&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大叔问起列车员的情况，很显然，她本科的学历让大叔震惊了，以至于后来的话题再也没绕出去过。大叔说大学毕业来当列车员可惜了，工作辛苦，怎么没去做些更好的事情。列车员说她挺喜欢这工作，工作两天休息三天，总能接触到形形色色的人，是很有趣的工作&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大叔仍然坚持青春年华拿来当列车员令人惋惜，我能听出列车员语气开始不耐烦了。大叔说这工作也不能做一辈子，迟早还要去做点别的事情。列车员说没错啊，她最多再锻炼一年，就回去创业了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;听出了语气中的厌恶，大叔也不再追问，嘟囔了一句“那好哇，平凡的岗位，年轻人继续努力”就再也没吭声了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;知识改变命运……确有其事吗？没有知识确实很难左右命运，但如果以大叔言语中透露出的价值观作为成功人生的评判标准，有知识的人，又有多少在“平凡的岗位”度过了自己的青春年华？改变命运的目的是什么，我想他没弄明白。至少，列车员大姐会为努力生活着的自己感到骄傲，烈日下的建筑工人会，整日奔波的快递员也会，水果店老板会，我也会&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;谁都有自己的活法，而且都得活下去，健康地活着就是最令人骄傲的事情，只是总有人对此视而不见。列车员怎么了！？两个小女孩还说在火车上上班很有意思，可以去好多地方。若是哪天你女儿告诉你长大想当列车员，我倒是很有兴趣看看彼时你那张脸&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大叔的职业不详，从言谈举止与穿着来看，基本可以确定是官员或垄断行业生意人。此时此刻，“知识改变命运”、“吃得苦中苦，方为人上人”等一堆心灵鸡血浮出我脑海。你们是所谓的人上人吗？别太高估自己，鲁滨逊还知道和星期五交朋友呢。如果在你们这些人眼中，支撑社会方方面面的平凡角色，都是令人不齿的下等工种，那祝你在自己的乌托邦中吃好喝好！&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>此情此景，昨日重现</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2512/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2013 19:09:10 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2512/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;阴天，有点小燥热。正要从银行回家，想起许久没有纯粹地骑车了。何谓纯粹地骑车？就是抛弃了它作为交通工具的意义，纯粹为了打发时间任由思绪飞舞而骑车。以往我经常如此，勉强算作一种孤独的运动。今年真的懒掉了，这样下去会长蘑菇的……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;租了辆公共自行车沿江骑行，我喜欢杭州有两个非常重要的原因：钱塘江、公共自行车，缺一不可。空气闷热，我的双肩包贴在背上，像块治疗风湿的膏药。骑行在江边的大堤，水平的路面、水平的护栏、水平流淌的江水，令人不自觉懒散下去。要知道，在设计的视觉语言中，水平的线可以表达平静、静止的意味。因此，在江边骑车有种独特的神奇体验，始终扭头望着江面，缓缓前行，感觉像是在看电影。堤坝以上都是荧幕，画面在幕布上缓慢移动，一定是部低成本慢节奏的生活哲理片。道路则是我身边的伙伴，上坡，下坡，它也随我一并起落&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;周围的空气纹丝不动，额头也沁出了汗珠，既然风不动，我动。猛蹬一脚冲上前方的缓坡，坡顶有清风徐来。然而我或升或降、或急或缓，辽阔的江面看上去始终如一，像某些抽象而宏大的东西，比如，时间。而此时此刻，距我第一次产生这样的联想，已经过去很长时间了……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三年前，即将毕业的我也是这样骑着车，在钱塘江畔悠然度过了一个又一个下午。下沙段的江面，景致与滨江段并无多大差别，无非江对岸少了几座山。此情此景，在脑海中如回魂般骤然点亮，那时候的我，是怎样一种心境？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回味大学的日子，要说轰轰烈烈那是扯淡，像这堤坝和江面，平淡如水才是真实写照。提前完成了毕业设计，大四下学期我没有课，也不急于找工作，经常回家，偶尔出去旅游。但绝大部分时间，还是在江边骑着借来的自行车，一骑就是一下午。直到今天，我才稍有领悟，那段时光，可以算作一种现代人的修行。听着各种风格迥异的音乐，静静陪着江水旅行，一下午所思考的事情，甚至比现在的一个星期还多，而所有繁杂纷扰，全部随清风而去&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想来也怪，那时的我出奇坦然，同学要么在忙毕业设计，要么参加了各种培训，或者已经找到工作开始实习了。白天在空荡荡的寝室里也坐不住，便给自己找了这么件事来做。不愁毕业，尽管我那时还挂着一门高等数学。不愁工作，根本就没去找过，就单纯相信船到桥头自然直。不愁未来，因为大学不曾虚度，没学到任何知识，却找到了理想。所以回忆起来，那时的我，脑中所想大多是些印加文明兴衰、机器人三定律、人类未来的能源危机之类&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后，我就这么若无其事地毕业了，若无其事地找到了工作，若无其事走上了自己选择的道路。家人介绍的所有工作，最终都没能改变我的志向，真希望能向每个时期的自己表达由衷的感谢。虽然有时也会犯懒，止步不前，总体还算积极勤快，如今的成就也不曾令自己失望。若是能见到毕业前的自己，我一定会忍不住给他剧透，告诉他不用担心，自己选择的生活真的不赖嘛。他的回答我大致也能猜到：“不担心，我相信自己，也相信你。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回过神来，此情此景已非彼时所见，这双眼睛却依旧如故。江水平直流动，来自过去，流过当下，奔向未来。它将流向何处，嗯……我现在还是不要知道的好&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>黑暗走向光明</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2194/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2013 14:34:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2194/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;《自新世界》是部非常特别的动漫。画得不算好，场景挺细致人物却很粗糙，而且画风经常变化。故事讲得也不算好，有些伏笔埋得过于明显，有些重要信息却又匆匆带过。然而这部剧还是深得我心，它的音乐非常赞。最最关键的是，其阴暗的世界观，让人震惊之余回味无穷&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/10527275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2013-04/04-10/1.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;世界观阴暗的动漫并不罕见，&lt;a class="link" href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/3430169/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;09版钢炼&lt;/a&gt;可以算一部经典。这类往往有个通用剧情，就是有人想要获得绝对的力量，成为超越神的存在，布下了一个可怕的局。自新世界的特别之处，在于人人都在维护固有秩序，而这秩序本身，却建立在巨大的阴影之上。没错，这正是一部反乌托邦作品&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那我们就来说说世界观【请注意，以下内容开始出现剧透】&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从某个时候起，部分人类发觉自己能够使用意念力，就是所谓“咒力”，人类社会的平衡就此被打破了。现代文明迅速分崩离析，人类倒退回了奴隶王朝，拥有绝对力量的咒力者，残暴地统治着普通人。其他咒力者与普通人则在不断试图推翻统治，历史一遍又一遍重演。终于，黑暗的奴隶王朝彻底灭亡，掌握科技文明的残余人类建立起了新的秩序&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;咒力这个设定很有趣，很新鲜，却不陌生，正是我们社会中种种绝对权力的象征。咒力的出现，决定了人类永远无法获得平等的待遇。政治上的压制、经济资源的占据，都使得部分人成为凌驾他人的存在，因为这些与咒力一样，是强大而可怕的力量。两类人群会在某种平衡——或者说不平衡中，找到支撑社会的支点。奴隶王朝的支点，是严重偏向咒力者的，普通人只有绝对的服从&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;结束了血腥黑暗的社会制度，新世界的人们努力建立起祥和的秩序。他们找到了一个实现绝对和平的办法，通过修改人类的DNA，使得人类在攻击同类时，体内的咒力会自然发作，产生种种不适，谓之“愧死机制”。若不及时停止，则会导致自己死亡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;百密一疏，人们不曾想到有两种人，可以越过咒力的屏障。少数人产生变异，愧死机制失效，成为心智疯狂的恶鬼。恶鬼肆无忌惮屠戮他人，他们却只能束手待毙。另一些人则在无意识中源源不断泄漏咒力，对周围的事物产生毁灭性影响，这类称为业魔的人，也不可以存在于世上。而这两种变异，都源自心灵的扭曲。为了防患于未然，不惜抹掉与篡改人的记忆，甚至将可能出现问题的个体预先清除，成为维护秩序之根本&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看到这层我已经不禁要拍手叫好。掌权者之间也有利益冲突，要相安无事，他们需要达成某种默契，权力的交换与相互钳制，正是愧死机制的工作原理。无论社会的上层腐朽到何种地步，只要心照不宣，便能相安无事。那些偶尔被除去的掌权者，往往是潜在的恶鬼与业魔，暴露出了颠覆的苗头&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;新世界是个平等的世界，人人和睦友爱，人人使用咒力，人人无所畏惧，果真是这样吗？【此处将涉及直指结局的终极剧透，往下看请三思】&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;新秩序的建立者们始终有个无法回避的问题——普通人。他们力量弱小，却不受愧死机制影响，反而成了咒力者最大的威胁。好在人们总有办法，哪怕狠毒至极。他们改造了普通人的DNA，将他们彻底变为一个新的物种，化鼠。不再受愧死机制保护的化鼠，成为仅次于人类的智慧生物，被阻隔在人类村庄之外，当作异类来管理。而新人类则抹杀了这段历史，再没谁知道普通人都去了哪里&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是，奴隶王朝改换形式重生了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是恐怖却合理的构想，与其百般藏匿社会的不平等，不如令所有人缄口莫言。若是真有这样的手段，难保我们的世界不会变得如此骇人。占据上风者，世世代代立于不败之地。庸碌凡人，则永无翻身之日&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>南昌见闻几则</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2177/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2013 15:20:15 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2177/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;公交车上听见旁边人打电话，带着浓重的乡土口音，说今年春节过得很爽。休息了四天，打了三天麻将。第一天赢了两百多，第二天赢了一百多，第三天输了四百多，全赔进去了，不过打的还是蛮过瘾的&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;麻将这项国粹在南昌被发扬得风生水起，是几乎家家户户节假日里最好的消遣。南昌人说，打麻将不玩钱那没意思。看来麻将的精髓，就在那四方桌上的钞票往来之中。常听说一些气度小的雀友，在桌上输了精光，倒还能对着一桌朋友发起脾气来，其玩牌之投入，着实令人钦佩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;至今我都还不会打麻将，不过这项概率性远大于技巧的运动，一点也提不起我的兴趣。若是辛苦大半年，春节只休息四天，我断然是不会去摸一下这东西的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;这条是老梗了。小钢过年转车回家，在南昌暂住一晚。我带他去吃辣锅，路过一家刚开张的店，爆竹震天，整条街的人都站到人行道上来远远观望，眼神呆滞，有些手上还抓了一把瓜子磕着欣赏。老一辈的南昌人喜欢嗑西瓜子胜过葵花籽，瓜子壳纷纷如雨下。这场面把小钢吓得不轻，他说他终于体会到南昌的民风彪悍&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;要我说当街打爆竹这种事情，还是有待商榷的。老祖宗的习俗里，爆竹驱灾辟邪，春节免不得要打上一串。既是驱灾辟邪，那店铺开张、新人拜堂、升学高就，怎么就不能打了？可这爆竹声响和漫天硝烟，在城市建筑间回荡，是何等的扰民。你若是有喜事急于分享，我倒乐意心中默默祝福，这么个闹腾法，便只好敬而远之了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再说这些围观看客，其实这才是小钢所震惊的。南昌人爱热闹，更爱看热闹，整个城市洋溢着一股浓郁的市井文化。看热闹者或手握瓜子，仿佛街头正搭台唱戏，或反手交握踮脚而立，哪里热闹哪有我。唱主角的，多是擦撞、口角、斗殴之类，围观的人多了，反倒还能助长主角们的气焰。所以小钢说南昌民风彪悍，我确实不敢否认&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_去深圳呆过两个月，才助我意识到南昌又一大特色。深圳整个是座新城，一切循规蹈矩秩序井然，我当时住在南山区，到了上班时间，路上连个行人都见不着。南昌可不一样，任何时间，总能看到些该是奋斗年纪的中青年，在街上大摇大摆晃荡，天南海北的吹牛胡侃，南昌人谓之“嗦泡”。老年人则沿街而坐，花坛边，水池旁，乃至胜利路口阻挡汽车的石墩上。这些老人家可能大清早就起床出发了，三三两两散步来到各繁华街道。每日的家长里短聊完之后，便找地儿坐下，盯着过往行人，一坐就是一整天。而且那真是“盯着”，行人经过，必能感到一束__束_呆滞空洞的目光将你牢牢锁定，像旋转的摄像头，让人心里发毛&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在杭州生活这么久，并不曾见过如此多的无业游民。我当然知道并非所有行业都朝九晚五，不过街市每日恍如周末，着实令人摸不着头脑。无业游民一词其实言重了，因为这些衣冠楚楚的市民显然过着并不寒酸的日子。他们有些脖子上戴着粗金项链，坐在街边的油腻小饭馆推杯换盏，空啤酒瓶占据大半张桌子。也有些当街架起桌子打起麻将，没错，又是麻将。难怪几位力挺南昌的朋友喜欢这里缓慢的生活节奏，悠哉悠哉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;这一则是听来的，某日家人吐槽了一位极品同事，这位仁兄的光辉事迹真当是我闻所未闻。一个锱铢必较的中年男人，公车开出去，总能用到一滴油不剩回来。中午单位食堂吃饭，食物本是按人头算的，他偏要带上家属来分，如此也就罢了，就连那汤锅里一人一颗的丸子，他也要排在前头一捞就是好几个。单位规定的工作文章，这人原本是半个字也不肯写的。出台了新规定，按篇给予稿费奖励，这位老兄摇身一变成为写作标兵，文章都是四处摘抄，最活跃的还是领稿费的时候&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也许这一则和城市无关了，哪里都会有这样的极品。我很好奇他的家人是如何忍受得了这个现世葛朗台，赚公家和别人的小便宜成了生活唯一目标。他每天要思考的事情，想必不比乔布斯少&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;后话&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有记忆以来，南昌城市变化好像挺大。后来在别处生活了，发现又不尽然。南昌的发展终归还是算缓慢的，像这里的生活节奏一样。安于现状的南昌人民，正是在这缓慢的节奏中，日复一日地传颂着这些俚俗打油诗，上演着那些市侩情景剧&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>惰之煞</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2053/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2013 19:45:08 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/2053/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;最近魔兽世界玩得有点过了，这个资料片新增了一个以中国道家文化为蓝本的种族：熊猫人，熊猫人的一个重量级敌人叫做煞。与以往的恶魔、亡灵、元素不同的是，这个强大的对手来自你的内心，是自己阴暗面的剥离。负面情绪构成三位极其强大敌人，狂之煞、恨之煞与怒之煞。但我觉得似乎还有一位被遗忘了——惰之煞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前三位敌人行动非常明显，会直接对你宣战。而惰之煞的攻击则是慢性的，它善于藏身阴影中，甚至常常伪装成己方势力，暗中发动精神控制。这样的敌人才最需要提防，不屈意志是必学天赋，冥思技一冷却就要使用，并及时驱散惰性诅咒。这个敌人无法被消灭，只有通过以上三个技能来压制。所以作为一位真实世界的玩家，注定是辛苦的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对抗惰之煞的诀窍看似简单几句，实则令人防不胜防。前两天发现身上的伤痕才知道自己中招了。说来不怕尴尬，由于把靠垫拿来当坐垫，长期捂着导致屁股上长了一颗痘痘，坐立难安。痘痘似乎也属于煞的一种，会从任何你意想不到的地方发动攻击，手指、嘴唇、眼皮、鼻尖、鼻翼。至于这个部位，还是头一回碰到，但万事皆有因果，原来我已经不知不觉作为熊猫人生活了两个月了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这情形有点像《商博良》里的血煞蛊，附在精美的器物上，让人禁不住身手抚摩。手指触碰到它时，皮开肉绽，血肉横飞，最终只剩一具痛苦的骸骨。一滴冰冷的水滴落在商博良后颈，才让人倏然清醒。而这颗痘痘，恰恰是那滴救命的水滴&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;相信以下特征并不罕见：不再听新歌，极少出门，信息来源越来越窄，豆瓣电影中的想看列表越来越长，书架上自己买来却没看的书所占比例也越来越高。身边朋友开始着手干一件大事，会强烈刺激一下你的大脑，决心自己也行动起来，然后……然后往往没有然后了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一定是惰之煞干的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;清醒了吗？那就立刻开始战斗吧。一个delete键，熊猫人的世界不见了。惰之煞离开了我的身体，谢谢你，勇士们。窗外阳光正暖，那才是我的世界&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>纯净的海</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1870/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2012 23:59:11 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1870/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;615的国庆假期，两辆车驶向温州近海的南麂岛。4天的短途自驾游，却好似一场心灵远行。因为那片纯净湛蓝的海，把每个人的心绪带去好远好远&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;刚买车的BB，新车还没过磨合期就带着我们上路了。sos与BB都是新手，走走停停途经多少隧道和服务站，当晚在瑞安住下，第二天我们将乘快艇前往南麂岛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我在海南看过夏天的海，热力四射，也在青岛见过冬天的海，苍劲雄浑。南麂岛秋天的海，又是另一番味道，宁静安详。船舱低矮，舱内看不到外面的景观。然而从大陆码头乘快艇上岛，竟足足用了两个小时，这岛离陆地想必是非常远。远离尘俗的海岛，应该会是什么样子，超出想象。直至快艇减速停船，全员踏上码头，人们第一反应都是拿出各自的拍照设备。因为码头的风景，就足以令人窒息&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岛上遍布这种小巷，十几户渔家构成一个小村落。由于旅游开发，渔民自家的房屋，也渐渐变成专供游客的海鲜餐馆与旅店。特别在这样一个上天入地皆无门的岛上，其黑心程度自然是可想而知。渔家饭菜口味清淡，所有海鲜都是一个做法，清水煮一煮便上桌了。岛上所有渔家无一例外寡淡如此。我们后来甚至发现，岛上的便利商店供应各类零食，却偏偏没有泡面。上岛游客定是逃不出这清汤寡水的五指山&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;渔家有个很萌的小孩，我们来店里点餐时还很淡定地在吊床上喊爸爸来给他摇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我们点好菜，老板和老板娘都去厨房忙活了。小屁孩在餐厅来来回回走了几圈，忽然毫无征兆开始哭着喊着找妈妈。615的怪蜀黍怪阿姨们顿时给逗乐了。我们一笑，小屁孩扭头过来，那笑得……完全看不出上一秒还在哭喊。于是……我们又笑了一遍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;网兜整整齐齐堆成一座小山，这样的小山在岛上随处可见，海洋气息浓郁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;渔家隔壁就是个超迷你的党支部，我相信里面书记、副书记、委员、各种部长都是同一个人。这是要多让人斯巴达啊，这种天高皇帝远的地方，每个小村子里都不忘安插一个党组织……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;晚饭点菜时，竹子从盆里捞出一只螃蟹，这么把它颠来倒去。我很诧异她在干什么。竹子折腾了一会儿，把螃蟹倒回盆里，说：“你看，它晕了。” 螃蟹仰面朝天，八条腿与两只钳子一动不动，瘫着了……话说我当时也很想这样&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在帐篷里呆了一晚，海风比想象中凉。带上的毛毯还远远不够用，背包里的所有衣服都拿出来当被子了，当晚大家都没睡好。清早赶往码头，寄存好帐篷和行李，大伙开始沿海岸游荡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至此，南麂岛之行即将结束。阳光很猛烈，饭菜很难吃，岛民很黑心，游客请慎入&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，相比这令人心神安宁的纯美，那些不幸……还真是过眼云烟&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>黑暗农场</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1759/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 21:53:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1759/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;最近在ipad上发现一个叫银河帝国的游戏，随意玩了玩，其中种种设定都让人联想起大刘的三体，那宏伟却逼近真实的宇宙文明假设，在这个游戏中体现得淋漓尽致&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;按下开始游戏按钮，宇宙边缘一个偏远星系，诞生了一支名为green的文明。我的视野中出现了一片荒芜的星球地表，任务系统提示我要尽快建设能源建筑，收集金属、晶体、瓦斯三种资源，发展科技与星际舰队，在宇宙中生存下去，壮大自己的文明&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可这并不是一款单机游戏，同样存在着由其他玩家经营的文明，大家可以相互攻击。游戏忽然有趣起来了，为了了解这个游戏的世界观，我派出侦查卫星观察了很多星球，也认真探索过星图。从某种程度上来说，这个游戏的世界设定与三体的宇宙观非常接近&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整个宇宙由十几个银河系构成，银河系中包含上百个太阳系，每个太阳系有10颗行星可以诞生文明。尽管相对真实宇宙，这数量也许太小儿科了。但在游戏中，这样的规模，已经可以做到无边无际了，几乎永远都无法探索完整个世界&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宇宙的宏大从空间层面已经得到了体现，同时时间层面也极其逼真。游戏中建造建筑、研发科技、星际航行所需的时间，都是按照现实中的时间来计算。将太阳能发电站从9级升到10级，需要耗费现实中8分42秒；研发天体物理科技2级，需要41分20秒；派出舰队攻击隔壁太阳系的一颗行星，舰队将在17分09秒后抵达目标……缩短版的时间线，使宇宙保留了空间感与神秘感。身处宇宙边缘的我，如果要去攻击宇宙另一头的一个文明，也许航行时间要上百个小时&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有最绝妙的一个设定，宇宙文明之间无法直接接触交流，玩家只能在一个公共频道聊天。聊天窗口显示的是玩家的用户名，而不会显示玩家星球的名字与坐标。如此一来，游戏中最有趣的一点出现了，想要去攻击某颗星球，只有唯一一个办法——设法知道它的坐标&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是在这个微观宇宙中，竟也应验了大刘的黑暗森林法则。每个文明都躲在黑暗中窥视着外界，文明间的沟通仅限于玩家的邮件往来，但通常不会有邮件往来。单一的了解方式与严重缺乏的交流，使得文明间产生了猜疑链，双方永远都无法确认对方是一个安全可靠的文明。果然，环境造就观念，本作为和平爱好者的我，在这样一个蕴藏着各种未知的宇宙中，也变得凶狠起来。因为攻击与毁灭其他文明，是维持自己文明存续的唯一方式&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在我所处的太阳系附近，发现了另一个文明，对我来说，它只是一颗星球图标，得不到任何信息。我不确定我是否先于它发现对方，但为了自己的安全，我决定先派出卫星侦查。得来的报告不容乐观，它的实力似乎只比我弱小一点点，却依然极度危险。因为游戏中有种叫做暗物质的东西，可以用来兑换另外三种资源，而且可以使建筑物建造与科技研发瞬间完成，这就是黑暗森林法则的第二个名词——技术爆炸。暗物质是种可以令文明一夜崛起的资源，在游戏中可以通过人民币购买，任何一个文明，背后可能都对应着一名人民币玩家&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但我仍然守着我的和平信条，直到它来侦查我……直到……它攻打了我的殖民地星球……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;血淋淋的黑暗森林法则！果然，在文明尺度的交流中，不存在和平与怜悯，只有毁灭与杀戮！生存下来，不是理所当然的事，仅仅是好运罢了。那么，我将就此改变策略。为了生存，我会毁灭一切比我弱小的文明！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;被攻击后损失不小，但我是留了后招的。我派去侦查的卫星是从殖民地星球出发的，所以我的主星坐标并没有暴露，而它的两颗星球位置都被我知道了，这个文明将永远见不到明天的太阳。主力舰队从主星部署到殖民地星球，再浩浩荡荡向两颗星球杀去。于是……我用了半支舰队的代价，手刃了游戏生涯中的第一个文明。而毁灭则使我更强大，掠夺来的资源，让我的文明高速发展。这……就是黑暗森林，大刘那真实到可怕的宇宙观&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过它说到底终归是个游戏，文明不会毁灭，否则被攻击的玩家还怎么玩啊。攻击行为会毁掉玩家的舰队和防御设施，并从玩家的星球抢夺大量资源，但文明可以继续发展，科技与资源建筑都不会受损。被攻击过的星球还有12个小时的保护期，不会再被攻击&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以我并不打算将这个游戏继续玩下去，因为……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我的空调是去年夏天买的，在京东商城上花1900买下，才用两个月夏天就过了。然后搬新家房东自带空调，我的空调就搁置了这么久，今年夏天才拿出来卖。空调已经拆下来打包好了，没办法上门看效果，但是搬家前这台正1P的空调在14平米的房间表现良好，制冷强劲，拆卸的时候也没有任何损坏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为一个实验，我的目的就是想测试卖家的真诚态度能否换来买家的信任，所以以上信息，我都如实发布在网上，还附上了空调的照片与京东商城的订单截图。如果换来的不是信任，甚至是更糟糕的东西，那么大致也能探知陌生人之间的信任，能够廉价到什么水平&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;略微讲价之后，终于有个买家决定以1360的价格要了，简单沟通觉得买家基本可信，于是实验继续下去。她问我能不能把这空调给她保留几天，现在她人在外地。好了，这时候让我们看看信任能换来什么。于是我说，如果你确定要，我就把网上的转让信息撤下来，就等你来取了。听到我这么说，她的声音中表露出一点意外，她或许没想到卖家会这么爽快&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;几天之后，买家联系我了，问我能不能当天来把空调买走。不巧那天我正在外面过生日，我让她和我的室友联系，委托室友帮我转卖。接下来发生的事情，说明信任还是需要建立在保障之上的。她说由于没法看到空调效果，不能确定空调是否完好，希望先付一部分，等空调装上确认后再全额补齐。对于这点，我其实并不太在乎。这个实验本来就充满风险，但最大的损失，也仅限于一台空调，而它所能证明的事情，价值却远超这1000多元。于是在电话里，我也二话没说一口答应了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实验的转机也恰恰出现在此时。买家也为了让我放心，主动提出会留下自己的一些个人信息，甚至包括住址和身份证号。这算是实验的意外收获，在这种情况下，如果有人主动用物品或信息换取信任，不论它们是否等价，已经基本可以说明先前单方面的信任发挥作用了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;朋友问我要是后面那部分她不给我怎么办？但我觉得事情发展到这个地步，就已经无需存有任何疑虑了，信任一旦建立，就会在相互作用中稳步放大。后来的几天我几乎都忘了这事，直到她主动来联系我，补上了剩余款项，实验以成功结束&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实验结果令人欣喜，人与人之间的关系，从陌生人到浅层次的相互信任，其实可以很快。我和买家甚至没有见过面，只通过3次电话5条短信。接触多少并不那么重要，重要的是要有人先伸出橄榄枝，在简单纯粹的场景中，并没有人会拒绝这种轻松的人际关系。而我们所生活的世界，对于信任，我们每一个人是否都略显吝啬呢……&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>国美毕业展</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1651/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jun 2012 16:28:04 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1651/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;上周末和竹子一块去看中国美院2012级毕业展，非常赞&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="http://book.douban.com/subject/4732123/" title="爸爸，我们去哪儿？"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;爸爸，我们去哪儿？&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作者让·路易·傅尼叶的三个孩子，前两个都是残障儿，这对于一位父亲，是何等尴尬与无奈。他倒不甘于愁容满面，而是以一种近乎自嘲的方式开起了自己孩子的玩笑，也许这是他表达爱的特殊方式，或是保持清醒的提神清茶。正如他在书中所说，作为残障儿的父亲，他可以开自己孩子的玩笑，这是他的特权&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;托马喜欢玩小飞机，喜欢把它们放在盒子里。他可以去当机场调度员，负责调度重型运输机的起落。他们是两个连自卫能力都没有的孩子。让-&lt;/em&gt;****&lt;em&gt;路易，你作为父亲，还这样取笑他们，不感到羞耻吗？不，这不影响我对他们的感情。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;路易没有假装，他是真的在开玩笑，但也如他所说，这不影响他对孩子们的感情。与这两个令人绝望的存在生活多年，他似乎练就了一身我们难以理解的豁达&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;你们是不是脑袋里进草了！&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是路易的管家对孩子们说的一句话，得到了路易的完全赞同，还一直被津津乐道。我敢说，路易第一次听到这句话是，他一定乐了，发自内心的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;我很喜欢托马三岁时拍的一张照片。他坐在小安乐椅上，我把他连人带椅子放到了大壁炉里，周围是柴架，下面是柴灰。他坐的地方，就是点火的地方——一个脆弱的小天使坐在魔鬼的位置上，脸上带着微笑。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我相信，这会是一张可爱的照片，只是小天使永远也不会知道，他的爸爸每次看着照片中的他，是什么样的心情&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;为了不让别人发现，也避免别人打扰，一到白天，他们就装回残障儿。为了享受安宁，他们假装不会说话。别人问他们话时，他们装作不知所云，这样就不用回答了。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这只是一个假设，这位无奈的父亲一辈子都在作无数类似假设，可喜的与可怕的，实际的与异想天开的，书中提及的与只字未提的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;但你们应该知道，我更喜欢你们，而不是彪悍的人猿泰山。你们是我的两只小鸟，你们更让我感动，你们让我想到了E.T.&lt;/em&gt;****&lt;em&gt;。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.T.也好，至少是独一无二的，也足够温暖人心，绝境中的乐观&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;也许演出真能打动观众，给他们留下深刻的印象。也许他们会给小费，我们可以拿小费买比赫酒喝，祝福他们的祖父身体健康。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;路易觉得他们一家完全具备上街乞讨的条件，自己与两个残障的儿子组成一个街头表演团体，兴许真能博得同情。然后还顺便吐槽了一下路易的父亲，也许两个残障儿的出生，与他们那嗜酒如命的祖父有些许关系&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;我凭空想出来几个跟学习有关的问题：“我说马蒂约，那个关于蒙田的作业怎么样啦？你的论述得了多少分？托马，你呢？你的拉丁语翻译里犯了几个错？三角学学得怎么样？”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这并不是心血来潮的打趣，这个疑问在路易心中埋藏了多久？有没有那么一丝可能，两个儿子的表现只是装出来的。这些问题会不会使他们说漏嘴而展露出正常的心智？如果换了我，能听到其中任何一个问题的答案，我一定喜极而泣，失声痛哭&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;我还琢磨着，等他们长大后，给他们每人买把像短剑一样大的刮胡刀，把它们关进浴室，任凭他们自己拿着刮胡刀折腾。等浴室里不再有动静了，我们就可以拿着粗麻墩布进去打扫了。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们无权责备路易这些可怕的想法，他能够将之公诸于众，那是他的忏悔。不是为这个想法，而是悔于创造了他们&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“我不妨直截了当地告诉你们，目前你们的处境非常糟糕。你们已经有两个残障孩子了，如果再添一个，你们的生活会有很大不同吗？但万一这个孩子是正常的，一切都会改变，你们就能走出失败的阴影，迎来生活的希望。”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当路易的第三个孩子将要出生时，他考虑过放弃。我很喜欢医生对他说的这番话，决定放弃的同时，也是拒绝了向命运还击的机会。很庆幸，这一回，他赢了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;在街上，遇到有人要我资助残障儿时，我都会拒绝。我不敢说自己也有两个残障儿子，怕他们以为我是在开玩笑。我会面带微笑，用轻松的语气告诉他们：“我已经给过钱了。”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还能说什么呢？相比这个，路易已经付出了巨大的代价，只是它太沉重，无从表达&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;他们确实很乖。他们天真无邪，眼里看不到任何丑陋的东西。他们来自原罪出现前的理想世界。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;孩子们没有能力正确的认识世界与自己，你却不忍责怪他们，他们会亲吻见到的每一个人，不带半点恶意，他们是真正的天使&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;几天前，我发现马蒂约占津津有味地看书。我激动坏了，赶忙跑过去。结果，我发现他的书拿倒了。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;路易其实很脆弱，任何一点渺茫的希望，都能另他热血沸腾。不过随之而来的，永远都是漆黑的绝望&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**_我想过在他的鞋尖上贴两面小镜子，像汽车反光镜一样，让他能看到天…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_****_他脊柱的侧凸不断加重，照此发展下去，可能会影响到呼吸。必须冒险给他的脊柱做一次手术&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_****_手术做完了，他彻底直起来了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_****_三天以后，他身体直直地离开了我们&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_****&lt;em&gt;手术让他看到了天，应该算是成功了吧。&lt;/em&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;马蒂约，路易的第一个孩子。他总是爱把皮球扔出去，再让人帮他捡回来，路易说，这回他把球扔得太远了，没有人能帮他&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;不要以为残障儿离开我们的时候，我们不会太悲伤，其实这和失去正常孩子没有区别。他从来不知道幸福是什么滋味，却已经离开了我们，真让人难过。他在人世间转了一小圈，体会到的只有痛苦。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这种痛苦应该比失去正常孩子还沉重，因为连让他微笑着离去都做不到&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**_“他几岁了？已经长大了吧？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;****&lt;/em&gt;“不，他没长大，衰老了，但没有长大。他永远长不大。脑袋里一旦进了草，就永远长不大了。”_**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;脑袋里进草这句话，一直被路易耿耿于怀，或者说津津乐道。至少用这个说法来描述他们的遭遇，程度足够吻合，却又不过于严肃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;我的孩子们和谁都不一样。我如此喜欢与众不同，这一次，我应该满意了吧。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果试着说服自己，这是一个爱他们的理由，那么久而久之，它也变得与其他父亲的爱没有差别&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**_托马害怕大海，害怕海浪拍过来的声音。我试着让他适应，抱着他走进海水里。他吓坏了，使劲抓着我。我永远忘不了他当时惊恐的表情。有一天，他终于想到了把我从海里骗出来的方法，好让我结束对他施加的“刑罚”。他露出非常急迫的表情，大声喊：“屎巴巴。”他的声音很大，竟然压过了哗啦哗啦的海浪声。我以为他要拉屎，赶紧把他从水里抱了出来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_****_但我马上意识到，他根本没事。我感动极了，托马不是傻瓜，他的小鸟脑袋里竟然有些智慧的火花&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_****&lt;em&gt;至少，他会撒谎了。&lt;/em&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从书中看来，托马的心智似乎比他的哥哥马蒂约健全一点，当然，还远不足以理解世界。可撒谎这么高级的思维活动，一定让路易开心了好一阵子&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;女儿玛丽对同学们说，她有两个残障哥哥。同学们都不信，她们都说这不可能，她肯定在吹牛。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;摘录这句，只是觉得“吹牛”一词实在是太讽刺了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;我原以为自己对他并不太重要，没有我，他也能过得很好，但也许我想错了。他让我感动，让我有负罪感。我曾讨厌和他生活在一起，讨厌每天带他去家乐福看史努比。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有一天托马在电视上认出了爸爸，他对着电视不停呼喊“爸爸”，等待着路易再次从电视中出现。托马可能还无法区分电视与现实中的人，但至少他能认出爸爸。不难想象，如若你许多年来都认为自己对某人可有可无，他无视你，你也无视他。忽然一天当你发现，他从不曾忘记你，你作何感？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**_托马已经成年了，可以投票选举了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_****_我敢肯定，他已经考虑成熟，权衡过参选双方的利弊，仔细研究过他们的竞选纲领和经济政策的可信度，还盘查过双方政党的幕僚班底。但他还在犹豫，还在举棋不定&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_****&lt;em&gt;到底选史努比呢，还是选米卢呢？&lt;/em&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;残障儿永远沉浸在孩子的世界中，他们的精神世界被坚硬的玻璃罩护着，让人琢磨不透。这些世俗的东西，完全无法打扰到他们透明的心&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;他换过一次宿舍。现在这栋小楼里只有十二个寄宿病人，都是像老小孩一样的成年人。他们没有年龄，他们的年龄无法确定。他们肯定出生于某年的二月三十日……&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这情形让我想起《飞跃疯人院》，心智健全的人置身其中，一定感到无比压抑，甚至不如成为他们的一员&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;我情不自禁地想到了瑞泽为残奥会创作的画：运动场上挂满了横幅，上面写着“禁止发笑”。&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们别无选择，了解这些可怜人，或是带他们走进我们的世界，多数时候都是天方夜谭。我们会做的，往往只有敬而远之&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;残障儿不会长大，与他们一起生活，年龄的概念变得模糊。时间像是停止在了真空中，在那里，除了伴随一生的痛苦与无奈，什么也没有&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>酱油打到了宁波</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1522/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2012 17:50:41 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1522/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;借着探望妹妹的名义，去宁波打酱油蹭吃蹭喝，顺便感受一下这座城市&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一座宁波城被Y字形的水道切成三块，而这些水道都远不及杭州的钱塘江宽阔。后者给人那样一种距离感，好像隔着江的两岸，交通、环境、房价等等相去甚远就可以是理所当然。而宁波城的三块区域被数不清的桥梁连接起来，形成相对紧凑的一个整体，这些桥，步行通过也就一两分钟路程&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宁波城市挺袖珍，当我带着杭州地图的比例概念走在宁波街头，我的距离概念就被严重干扰了，明明地图上看似要坐3站车的距离，怎么走5分钟就到了。这个规模给人一种宠辱不惊的安全感，喜悦与烦恼似乎都和这城市一样，大不到哪去&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宁波没有太多娱乐场所与设施，除去鄞州与其他新开发的区域，天一广场是老城区最具影响力的商业中心，以购物为主。不过这个广场确实让人眼前一亮，它是圆的！广场中央被喷水池环绕的区域偶尔用来举办一些露天活动，商铺环绕在外并排列成不同大小的同心圆，圆圈同时也是道路。这样的布局规划，商铺的容纳量更大，而且似乎比那些横平竖直的商业街区更聚人气。不过缺点也显而易见，这个商业中心无法再向外扩张了，超出广场容量的商铺，一旦脱离了这些精心规划的环形结构，就被排斥在外了，人气骤降&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;当天晚上我住在一家简洁清爽的商务酒店，叫桔子酒店，柜台送了我个手提袋，里头还真是两颗桔子……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;酒店房间桌上摆着魔方和一只小金鱼缸，卡片上的文案写得不错&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二天宁波气温顿时大变，我尴尬地穿着4件衣服在烈日下游荡，这果然也是个没有春天的地方。妹妹公司放她一天假来陪我，这时候街上就很清静了。走在河边的绿化带可以让我不至于热到出汗，一群穿校服的中学生说笑着迎面跑来，跑到我们身后不远处又折返，学生日子这么清闲？再向前走了一段终于明白，河边站着一位身着运动装双手叉腰的中年人，脖子上还挂着一只哨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2012-03/03-24/4.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;妹妹说，上海外滩的模式还是宁波人带过去的，要带我去宁波的老外滩看看。老外滩其实只是短短的一条酒吧街，白天店门紧闭，倒是有人在街上拍婚纱照&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;接近正午，我们钻进宁波美术馆避避烈日。馆内几乎只有工作人员，展出的画作甚至有些还暴露在空气中，不过我也仅仅是来乘凉的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2012-03/03-24/7.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;妹妹打算下午带我去城隍庙逛逛，我没意见。不过实际上各个城市的类似地方，都相差无几。宁波确实不大，我们去哪都是步行。正因为如此，我们最终在天一广场的星巴克坐了一个下午。一座城市而已，能有什么非去不可的地方？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下午聊起妹妹在宁波的生活。她不像我，没事会一个人四处溜达，做事全凭兴致，独自在家也能从容过活。她很需要和朋友打发业余时间，一个人就只能宅着，更缺乏锻炼。然而她若是能拥有自己的圈子，一定能成为核心人物，反倒会比我甚至绝大部分人都活得滋润潇洒，我并不知道她如何办到这点，但我可以作证，这确实是她的本事。妹妹说宁波有点呆不下去了，我也赞同，若是能回南昌去，她绝对如鱼得水&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;感谢妹妹的款待，晚餐她团购了一家很特别的餐馆，名字就让人摸不着头脑：鸡毛兑糖。尽管我不明白，隐约听出点老宁波的感觉，莫非是传统小吃的名字？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2012-03/03-24/8.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;口味果然是典型的江浙甜，喜欢到不行啊。看来她真是煞费苦心，带我走了这么大老远，问过好几次路，去到城市里这个她也不甚熟悉的角落&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那就不说啥了，咱们上菜！再次感谢妹妹的盛情，愿你早日摆脱困境&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="客厅"&gt;客厅

&lt;p&gt;615的新家是复合式六室二厅，上下两层总面积220平，最让人喜欢的就是这个宽敞明亮的客厅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其实，以前公司年会中的奖品我一直留着，当时还觉得这电视机很大来着，往这客厅里一摆，顿时就变成了小霸王学习机啊……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;连接上下两层的楼梯，楼梯旁边的墙壁渗水脱落，房东已经找人修复过了，不过下雨时墙面仍然有些潮气&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这个楼梯可是有天窗的喔！～ 第一次来看房子的时候，我抬头看见了这扇天窗，顿生感慨：“这才是生活啊！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="露台"&gt;露台
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2012-03/03-17/13.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;我们住在整栋楼的顶层，二楼还附带一个露台，不过你一定不会想知道我们打扫干净前，它是个什么样子&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="我的房间"&gt;我的房间
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2012-03/03-17/14.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的房间在楼上，二楼的主卧，这近乎于落地窗的采光，无可挑剔啊。不过有一点，阳台朝南，加上是顶楼，不知道夏天会是个什么状况……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;还有阿文和我分摊房租，阿文这被套还是大学里的，上面bicycle这个单词都印成了blcycle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;衣橱是个问题，实在找不到合适的地方。这个带镜子的衣橱正对床尾，半夜起床镜子里的影像，不是阿文诈尸就是我诈尸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;房间外是个不小的阳台，目前阳台大半是露天的，没法晾衣服。夏天我打算给它安个遮阳棚，咖啡馆门口那种&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2012-03/03-17/25.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;阴冷的秋风从阴影中扫过，带着旋转的落叶，肆无忌惮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-10/10-25/1.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;云层仍在不停扩张，傍晚时分也许就会吞没整个天空&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不能让这邪物坏了雅兴&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;冲！冲出这阴霾，甩开所有的不快，逆风我在行&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-10/10-25/2.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回到光芒万丈的世界，难以置信这是同一个下午的天空&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阳光贴着云层的边缘洒在脖子上，然后是衬衫袖管，最后洒满全身，暖意正浓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;似乎这一刻，我被一分为二了。仅一线之隔，我站在金色的阳光中，而我的那个幻影，带着所有迷惑，被拦在阴影里眼睁睁地望着我&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一出有点像《蜂蜜与四叶草》，竹本顶着滂沱大雨骑车冲上高坡，在坡顶云破日出的那一刹那，一切困惑与未知顿时有了答案&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-10/10-25/3.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;乌云又跟过来了，它吞噬天地的速度正在加快&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;冲！若是躲不开，就向暴风眼进发！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一幕又让我想起了《黑客帝国》，尼欧驾着飞船甩开围追堵截的机械章鱼，冲破云层看见纯净的阳光，便又一头扎进云里，向着那不可一世的机械帝国杀去&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阴影中的气温至少要比外面低3度，暴露在空气中的皮肤有点麻木&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-10/10-25/4.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;看见这样的天色，我第一反应却是个英文单词，leak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;希望之光正是从云缝中漏出，倾泻而下，我喜欢这样的意境&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阴云今晚就将散去，明天，一定是灿烂辉煌的明天&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>不要碰我的孩子！</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1241/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2011 17:27:24 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1241/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;我们平时没事就开人家城管玩笑，不过玩笑归玩笑，它不代表任何态度或立场&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想起黄鱼和我说的经历，他老人家在小摊吃东西，城管来了，这厮还在低头猛吃。店家无奈来央求他，小伙子你就别吃了~让我收了摊子啊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这便是夹缝中生存的小贩们的处境，头顶悬着高额罚金，售卖那些不健康却依然大有市场的各类小吃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;城管呢，同样处境艰难，无论他们做什么，在不假思索的人看来，都是错的。只因为在冲突中，道德天平往往倒向弱势的一方&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之前就看到过一次，少量城管在彩虹城门口没收小贩的鲜花，很安静，没有什么争执&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;昨晚亲眼目睹楼下大批城管与小贩的对峙，这回也没有太大异动，我家附近一带的城管都还算文明。几个执法人员与摊主交涉，交涉顺利后，才由其他人静静把小车拖走&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;交涉到巷子最深处的一家烧烤摊时，围观人群开始有些骚动，就像台风一样，四周风起云涌，台风眼却静悄悄的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;终于，台风眼有动静了，摊主想到一个办法企图保住他的烧烤车。他趁城管不备，一把抱起身边几岁大的儿子，放在烧烤车上，大声呵斥执法人员，“不要碰我的孩子！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一开始，城管还真拿这招没办法，只得继续和摊主交涉，摊主绝口不提违章与罚款的事，只反复强调着不准碰他的孩子。见摊主根本不愿好好说话，城管开始试探性慢慢拉走烧烤车，小孩不知是配合还是真怕了，立马就嚎啕大哭起来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有城管迅速把摊主的孩子抱下来放在地上，摊主一个箭步冲上前去，抱起儿子再次放在车上，小孩哭得更加变本加厉，这回肯定是怕了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中央是烧烤车与摊主父子，城管人马在旁边围了一圈，围观人群又在更外面裹了一层，整个人群就这样里三层外三层一点点挪向巷子尽头的马路，拐过路口消失在建筑之后&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;城管与小贩的矛盾见仁见智，不过换了任何一个当爸爸的，你斗胆这么对自己的孩子么？靠着烧烤车养家糊口，孩子可曾怨过？孟母不欺子，为人父母身体力行，岂是安顿吃住就够的？更何况用孩子当挡箭牌？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，还有一种可能，这只是他随手抱起的一个路边小孩而已，那没什么好说，纯属缺德了&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>中秋快乐</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1190/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2011 12:19:33 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1190/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-09/09-13/1.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这已经是中秋的第二天了，昨天和一位同行大哥聚了聚，聊了很多大事小事，受益匪浅，也感谢大哥送来的月饼，里面百果口味的很好吃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过始终没觉得有中秋节的样子，好像只是个加长版周末而已，什么时候开始变成这样了呢？911也过去10年了，那时的中秋有比如今更像中秋吗？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BB问我老家怎么过中秋的，我憋了半天还是只能给出这个回答：大家聚一块吃饭，没了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;相比之下，BB老家的中秋要丰富一些，除了吃月饼之外，还会在阳台摆上一个南瓜供奉月老，旁边还配上各式水果与一碗清水，被月老恩泽过的清水，涂在眼睛上，据说可以明目。可以想象这样一幅场景，全家老小挤在阳台上，小辈们从大到小站成一排，由爷爷或者奶奶挨个在眼睛上涂上明目的清水，然后小辈们揉揉眼睛，抬头仰望当空的明月&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就这方面意义来说，这些传统节日真是比劳动节国庆节有文化得多，只是其意义在城市中已经渐渐消失了。对于大多数在城市里奔波的上班族，中秋节也许就意味着和家里通个电话，吃个月饼，抬头看一眼或几眼月亮，然后就和朋友钻进KTV与酒吧了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;至于赏月，似乎并不是那么吸引人，在被城市灯火染色了的夜空中，那轮月亮显得有点暗淡。这很像黄色的特点，纯度极高的时候最为鲜艳，然而只消参杂一点点灰，立刻变得暗淡失色。思密达告诉我她想到一个不错的书名，叫广角的天空，但这景象在城市里几乎见不着。我也只见过两次，一次在郊外的山上，一次在海边。在天空开阔的地方，抬头看自己的正上方，视野中不再有大地，整个夜空尽收眼里，而且很明显有广角镜头下的扭曲效果。赏月就该如此，月亮、星海和那无尽的虚空是一个整体，是一副从各个角度看都无懈可击的构图。不过我昨天所见，只是泛红夜空中的一轮孤月，被禁锢在黑压压的建筑轮廓当中。而闪烁在城市夜空的，通常是飞机&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，城市也有城市的过法，桃子说她朋友两口子去明月山上扎帐篷了，晚上赏月清晨看日出，无比浪漫啊。这一出必须掌声鼓励，它可以说是一项研究活动，旨在挖掘传统节日的现代含义，任何研究活动，都是值得尊敬的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过话说回来，惋惜也好，羡慕也罢。要使得节日与普通的每一天过得有趣，这并不是社会的责任，而是你我自己的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后感谢章鱼同学不依不饶的关注啊，灰常感谢 ^.^&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>山雨欲来风满楼</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1163/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2011 23:52:11 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/1163/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;上周末跟着SOS小两口去上海探望小钢，朋友说我不带这么潇洒的，工作都没还能这么淡定&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我去过上海4、5次了，说实话没什么好玩，不过SOS夫人第一回到上海，于是一行四人去了环球国际金融中心和城隍庙。小两口当天晚上就回来了，我留下陪小钢宅了一天&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这两栋建筑很有戏剧性，金茂大厦从前是上海第一高楼（不算附近的东方明珠塔），而环球金融中心就在它的身边拔地而起，夺去了它的桂冠。上海就在这样无休无止的较劲中发展到天上去了&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;环球金融中心的底部，小钢说这建筑是日本设计师的作品，而金茂大厦则是上世纪典型的美国风格&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小钢上班地点就在环球金融中心里，这个磁铁形的雕塑他一直没看懂。我估计N和S代表着北半球和南半球吧，加起来就是环球了，而磁铁的意义在于，它将会把全世界的财富吸引至此&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小钢在上海出差一两个月了，每天往返于公司和如家快捷，他对上海生活的描述中，提到了一个词，行尸走肉。每天穿梭于错综复杂的地铁网络，转车，再转车，地铁众人都低头默默翻着手机，也包括他自己，行尸走肉一般，这和我在深圳所见颇有几分相似。乘公交去城隍庙的途中，有老人从前门上车来，一路踉踉跄跄走到后排，我站起来示意他坐下，我很想问车上这一半坐着的年轻人，在上海，让座这种事情都得靠游客吗？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上海归来气温骤降，入秋时节却下起了春日里的毛毛雨，吃过午饭决定出去散散心&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;跨上自行车，沿着钱塘江一路向南，直到六合塔都远远消失在浓雾中&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;雨丝在眼镜片上蒙了一层轻纱，刚好可以看见一切原始之美，滤尽尘嚣浮华&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整个天空，在蒙蒙雾气与乌云笼罩下，呈现着一种令人不安的宁静，宁静中有那么一种厚积薄发的气势，静止的万物背后，都似藏着万钧之力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;果然，只一瞬间，山雨欲来风满楼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沿着江岸一路骑行，我忽然明白为什么人们向往大海，向往一望无际的平原。因为那是平直的线，就像这水平的江面、路旁水平的栏杆、对岸水平的山丘，置身其中，无比安详&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-08/08-24/11.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;山雨欲来风满楼，撇开这个词的感情色彩，仅从它所描绘的场景来看，很有力量&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;张开双臂感受这股威严，力量直达心底，这便是自然的馈赠&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>妈湾的美丽集装箱</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/919/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2011 22:51:22 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/919/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;来深圳的第二个周末，决定出去认识一下这个城市&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;乘公交漫无目的地穿梭，发现公交线路上有一站叫妈湾，会不会是海边呢？不管了，上路！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;途径某一站时候，司机提醒我们，去月亮湾的在这里下车了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;月亮湾才是海岸吧，我今天就是想去妈湾，怎么了！？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从深圳的地图上看，南山区能看到大海的两个地方，都是狭小的海湾，想必没有令人心旷神怡的辽阔海岸&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;到站下车，果然是海边，只是视野中没有半滴海水，倒是遍布五彩斑斓的集装箱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="来对地方了"&gt;来对地方了！！
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;没随身带着相机，只得用手机将就，说实在的，我不喜欢处理过的照片&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这张PS失败，算是示意图吧&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>哈，我真是个疯狂的人</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/891/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2011 22:01:15 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/891/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;刚来深圳，第一天上班，感觉倒是挺有趣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我不愧是个情绪大起大落的人，心情有时候会突然180度大转弯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天上班没估计好时间，早到了近半个小时，深圳就没有给力点的空调么！？我住处的空调制冷差，只能把温度降到25度左右，公司的空调居然也形同虚设，吹出来的都是个风啊……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公司地点在万恶的腾讯大厦隔壁，腾讯大厦还比俺们楼高出一截，各种不爽啊有木有&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看着那只挂在建筑顶层的硕大企鹅，真想一脚踹过去&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前几天还和人杰在网上YY，说企鹅大厦没我们想象的那么简单&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其实在企鹅大楼的下方，极其可怕阴谋在进行着&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;地面以上，是腾讯的行政、公关等常规部门，而地面以下，搜索引擎山寨部、网游山寨部、软件山寨部、电子商务山寨部等等不计其数的邪恶机器在昼夜不息地运转着&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;企鹅大厦脚下方圆几十里的土地，都早已被腐蚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;只等某天夜里，企鹅大厦四周方圆几十里的各大型企业写字楼同时不翼而飞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;取而代之的，是从地底隆隆升起的新世界，新世界保持着之前完全相同的外观，只是都屈从于邪恶的企鹅帝国&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这样，企鹅便不留蛛丝马迹地将万利达、TCL等各行各业的巨头据为己有，人类的末日就要来到了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好吧言归正传，今天上班第一天公司里只有3个人，算上我在内，着实让我吃惊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人事介绍说，除了我们两和另一个销售人员外，公司的另外4个人都随老总出差了，我还是第一回接触处在这个阶段的公司，有种麻雀虽小五脏俱全的精致&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的工作是埋头捣鼓公司网站，唯一不用出差的人员，据说最近公司要集体出差一次，到时就只剩我和新招来的会计了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;至于这摸不着头脑的工作，宣传文案、原型图、设计稿、前端UI、数据库、搜索引擎优化一个都不能少……我表示亚历山大，不过好像蛮好玩的哈哈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;深圳天气很热，城市也少了点生活味，但是云非常漂亮，像拉普达，有种很能安抚心灵的感觉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;虽说我在此只短暂逗留一个月左右，却也没有那么叫人绝望&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;至少，我又新添一件作品，话说我还打算趁这时间接触一下PHP，而公司也可以在网站初步成型之后，聘请更专业的网络推广人员，大家都各有收获，皆大欢喜啊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;哎我果然是个自我调节能力极强的疯子&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>千岛湖</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/171/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2011 00:26:15 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/171/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;再过3天……我就满一个月没写博客了！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;国庆前的疯狂加班、隔三差五的同学小聚和意料之外的琐事&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;各种忙碌让我一个月没了动静&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;国庆前的一周……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-05/82.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这厢，615的国庆千岛湖之行蓄谋已久，我却几乎没空过问，万务缠身中，行程已经不知不觉安排好了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10月1日的杭州……我们居然还是个汽车大国，只可惜不是交通大国&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;经历了一点小波折，各路人马总算还是准时坐上了长途汽车&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当天的悲情人物应该就是我了，前一天晚上感冒，早晨出门嗑了4粒感冒清&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那一整天，如果不是大家拉着我到处玩，我觉得我站着都能睡着&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;坐游轮在千岛湖上吹吹风，隔一阵子级登上一个小岛晃悠一圈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;昏昏欲睡中，第一天的行程用七个“很”字便足以概括&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我很困&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;鱼头很美味&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;湖上的岛很挫&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;拍的照片很少&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;615还是很猥琐 - -|||&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;喂鱼女很寂寞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;人命很贱&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后两条有必要解释一下&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;喂鱼女是某个岛上的一个普通女生，她的工作是看管一个鱼池，并向游客出售面包屑喂鱼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们看见的第一个鱼池里养着各色硕大的鱼，每一条都足有半人高，池边围满看客，整整齐齐一圈后脑勺&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-05/86.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;喂鱼女的鱼池就在旁边，她的池子里只有一些非常普通的红鲤鱼，游客都只瞄上一眼就匆匆离去，无人驻足&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当我们经过的时候，喂鱼女百无聊赖地拆开了一袋面包屑，一块一块自己吃了起来……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人命很贱那一条就说来话长了，是SOS那听来的，关于母校的骇人事&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;话说杭州某大学的4人寝室要改为6人寝室，导致已经大四的学生劳师动众搬了一次寝室&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然而忽然间又要来一批新疆学生，还需要他们再搬一次，一时间怨声载道&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为了维稳需要，学院书记带上一个学生去向校长反映&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;恰巧这个学生经历特殊，来读大学时已经比同学长了好几岁，看上去倒更像是学院的辅导员&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;书记也没明说，校长一看在座没有学生，便收起和蔼真情流露：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“他们有情绪？能有什么情绪？就是要跳楼，我这也还有3个指标！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;考大学，没有张三李四王二麻子，谁都是茫茫人海中的一个指标&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;奖学金，没有张三李四王二麻子，谁都是茫茫人海中的一个指标&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;毕业生，没有张三李四王二麻子，谁都是茫茫人海中的一个指标&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;只是我没想到人命也可以是指标，好在我们千岛湖之行6个指标顺利毕业，没有影响到校长大人的政绩啊，我心宽慰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;千岛湖镇就像庐山市，都是旅游景区中的一个袖珍城市，然而麻雀虽小五脏俱全，甚至还有一些景区独有的地方&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们晚上住在班长的亲戚家，那是一栋建在水面的房子，平时供钓鱼爱好者娱乐休息，也提供各种珍稀野味&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-05/87.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自从读大学睡学校的竹席，我已经很久没有睡过草席了，干爽的草席有一股特有的香味&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;枕头下就是湖面微凉的风和浅浅的涟漪，今天能做个好梦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;小钢说，我倒下不到5分钟，他们就听到了呼噜声，照片摄于第二天早晨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二天起来我就完全变了个人，变得颇有干劲，可空有干劲，行程已近尾声，吃顿饭就要打道回府了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;用SOS的话说，作鸟兽散，呈猥琐状，一字排开，一会儿排成S，一会儿排成B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;离去之前拍下了这栋水上的小屋，别有一番味道&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最后……每次看到这种喜羊羊样子的玩具车，我总会情不自禁的鄙视一下&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>屡试不爽</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/167/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2011 00:25:05 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/167/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;四天晚上加班到9点以后&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;结果事情还是没做好&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;心情有点低落无法避免&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但没必要沉溺在这样的心情里&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二战期间，在法国沦陷，欧洲只剩英国在苦苦支撑的时候，伦敦市民自发地戴起钢盔走上街头，在遍地瓦砾中跳起舞来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;丘吉尔看见万般感慨，他说：“巴黎还活着，却已经死了；伦敦已经死了，却依然活着！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;抛开无谓的沉重，一切都要继续，一切都将散发光芒&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;需要被记住的只有一件事——先做到仔细，才有资格谈水平&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;雾蒙蒙的阴天&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在家里继续工作着&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;心情和空气一样沉闷&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没关系，骑车永远是屡试不爽的方法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;准备工作：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;往手机里灌一堆音乐，如果选得仔细，背景乐器首选吉他&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;找一件格子衬衫穿上，还有我那双轻便的网球鞋&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;带上一瓶饮料，绿茶为佳，我坚信这是一种可以调节心情的神奇饮料&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;当然最好要把自行车检查一番，踏着没有气的钢圈颠簸一大圈，任谁心情也不会好&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;昨夜一场狂风暴雨，电梯门开的一刹那，清新的风扑面而来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;戴上耳机，跨上单车，心情立刻就会好起来，让人很想把笑容挂在脸上&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;离开小区，漫无目的地瞎逛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没错，就是要让自己迷路，就是要去陌生的地方&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;附近一带是个复杂的综合体&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也许上一分钟还在高架桥下行驶，下一分钟就骑进了田间地头，再下一分钟又得从桥下穿过铁轨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在其间寻找着一切能想到的东西：甘蔗田、原始的路边小店、水泥墙上的涂鸦、还有最经典的“圈”+“拆”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整个天空的云都在密谋着一场雨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;地面闷热潮湿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;昨夜的大雨并没有洗净这片大地，反而让灰尘都堆积在道路的两旁，整个自行车道被一层厚厚的烂泥覆盖，我只能骑在汽车道上&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一辆货呼啸而经过，数百米尘土飞扬，屏息好久都不曾散去&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;荒野是袋鼠的家
雨林是猿猴的家
草原是斑马的家
城市是人类的家&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为地球上最具智慧的生物，人类的家却是最污浊的地方，何其讽刺&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前苏联切诺贝利核电站泄露之后，这片区域被人类遗弃了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如今多少年过去了，它没有死去，反而在大自然的呵护下生生不息&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;究竟是人类遗弃了这座城市，还是大自然遗弃了整个人类？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;天渐渐暗下来了，在这个开发中的城市角落，入夜后很多路段将伸手不见五指&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;该回家了，未完的工作还被搁置在那一个个图标里&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;周末接近尾声，新的一周即将开始，生活万岁！&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>克莱默们 The Kramers</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/157/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2011 00:22:00 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/157/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;《克莱默夫妇》不仅仅是电影&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首先，周末means，睡个懒觉先！否则那还是我么……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;养足精神，下午有场大戏啊，毕业后头一回，615再集合了！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;正如我和PIZZA说的，会离开的早已离开，会回来的随时都会回来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除了独孤大侠，他仍在一如既往地苦练某门功夫，真人永远是不露相的，看来他已经离我们远去了 &lt;del&gt;.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没关系，另外两位意料之外的贵人现身了，每位都带着浓重的传奇色彩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;老大从萧山赶来，赶这个字用的是极其精确的，因为7公里多的路程，他大半是走来的，大热天里应该快走成人干了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;哎所以奉劝各位，以后出门前查公交，千万别用百度地图&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个道理，老大用厚实的双脚默默地为我们诉说着&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另一位传奇就是我们的芳草同学，这传奇需要两个人共同谱写&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在此祝福YMQ和芳草同学，咱不跟你客气，里面绝对有我们615的功劳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下午，稍息片刻，第二站，YMQ的宿舍，行程几乎横跨了整个滨江&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;途经BB面试过的公司，途经老大面试过的公司，途经我面试过的公司……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;原来工作来之不易，原来生活来之不易&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;小饭馆里简单的晚餐，却让一直蒙在鼓里的我们终于揭开了冰山一角&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;正吃着，YMQ的同事正巧也来了，从他们口中听出一些端倪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看来关于和芳草同学的事，YMQ还有很多瞒着我们大家伙，整个就是个大谜团&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;晚餐后随YMQ逛传说中的“垃圾街”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拐过街角的那一刹那，我愣住了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有种错觉，像是我已在此生活多年，每个角落都仿佛回荡着我记忆深处的小旋律&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;狭窄拥堵的街道，充斥着满面油光小摊贩和油腻腻味道，像极了几年前的南昌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那时的夜市、螺蛳和皮蛋粥，还有渗入人心的市井味道，家的味道&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在“垃圾街”中几乎寸步难行，呆的久了，似曾相识的感觉更加强烈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;像极了我的小说《天街的梦》，嘈杂混乱的街道，也可能是最美好的天堂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想必此刻牵着手的YMQ，能够看见完全不同的天街&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我多久没动笔写过点故事了，恐怕我已经丧失了这个能力，没关系，它终究还会回来的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在“垃圾街”臃肿的繁华下，也藏着深深的静谧&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;街边时有黝黑深邃的小巷，和外界形成极其鲜明的对比&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想起我小时候在北京旅游的日子，住在京味十足的胡同里，胡同外面车水马龙，宛如隔世&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;天色微亮，院子中央的方桌边，土生土长的北京人喝着白粥啃着白面馒头兴致勃勃地神侃，也许这情形现在已经见不到了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人类发展的光轮照亮未来，同时也在碾碎回忆，“垃圾街”也会有消失的一天&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下次，我一定带着属于我自己的单反来，亲手拍下这些似曾相识的回忆，还有我笔下的天街实景&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;周日，懒觉无悬念&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下午再次横跨大半个滨江去了“垃圾街”，想看看它白天是什么样子&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个人瞎转悠，却怎么也找不着了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;天街、桃花源记、千与千寻里的灵魂夜市，忽然觉得这些故事惊人的相似&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;找不着没关系，我另有任务&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;买了一辆自行车再横跨大半个滨江骑回来，手机里的五月天很久没有换过了，还是那么适合做单车音乐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;经过一个小广场，立着十几个自行车运动员比赛中的侧面雕像&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我路过的那会儿，若是被人拍下来，应该会是挺有趣的构图&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;啧啧……最后一件事，就是待会儿的世界杯决赛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尽管我喜欢的球队都已经回家了，但作为一个年轻人，一个热血伪球迷，不看世界杯决赛，都不好意思跟人打招呼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;黑着眼圈上一天班又算的了什么&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还能睡两个小时先～～～&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>处以绞刑！！</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/138/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2011 00:05:20 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/138/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;三年的噩梦结束了，回想起来仿佛过了半个世纪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;挥之不去的心魔，那令人咬牙切齿的名字，此刻顿时灰飞烟灭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如此仍无法平息我心头的怒火，朋友一再劝我坦然、淡定，但就这件事，我意已决，任天也拦不住我&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;仓促的一场雪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;来不及去西湖聆听这场华丽的交响&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但这一个纯白的下午&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;足够将今年所有想要丢掉的情绪都深埋雪中&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;萌动着下一季的绚烂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;目前：也许以后有钱了 我会改变喜好的……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不知道为什么 学校的被套床单枕头套上要印上这个单词 大学就是有文化氛围 唯一可惜的是错印成了blcycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还是进入正题吧……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;端午休假的最后一天 看完了《悬崖上的金鱼公主》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;被这个清澈透明的故事打动 疯狂的想要回到那个天马行空却又夹杂着小小邪念的初中时代&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;往手机上塞了一堆轻音乐和安静的歌 抓起耳机就直奔车库去了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;气温30度左右 自行车带起阵阵微风 很舒适的天气&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;七、八年前我就是骑着一辆当时看来很拉风很阳光的变速跑车上下课&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同样是变速跑车 今天这辆车沧桑了许多 也许我那辆被偷的车活到现在 就是这个样子&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;慢速行驶在道路上 来往车辆的引擎声盖不住耳机里小野丽莎的哼唱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;网球鞋 连帽格子衬衫 粗表带的电子表 抬起头 似乎全世界的阳光都照在我身上 差点没把我晒死 &lt;del&gt;.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大学城是东西走向的一条狭长带状区域 我的学校在最东端 momo的在最西端&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本想去找momo 把这些多的没处花的惬意分一些给她&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没找着 倒是发现momo的学校旁边有一个消防主题公园 标志建筑是用一些红色线条构成的火焰形状 挺有趣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;音乐的魔力的确强大 不同的节奏直接影响到我蹬踏板的频率&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;听着前一首钢琴曲少女的祈祷 我只想慢悠悠滑过这个红绿灯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;进入下一首欢快的beautiful day 我好半天才发现自己蹬车的动作是那么有节奏感 还不自觉跟着旋律频频点头&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;向北走靠近了绕城高速 大小货车把这里弄的尘土飞扬 硬生生将我给逼了回来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;只好往南去 经过几个大商业区 前方是工业园&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;道路顿时宽敞起来 双向六车道 没有行人 没有商铺 黑压压一片都是厂房 只有货车停靠在路边等待发货&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;巨大的集装箱上印着“China Shipping” 食品也好、原材料也好 都将漂洋过海来到一个陌生的国家 商人肯定是触角最长的一种动物&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这些公司的标志我都没见过 有些简洁 有些直观 不过我至少认出了一个&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个厂房门口的货车上 满载着康师傅冰红茶的纸箱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;离开工业园继续向南 这里有几所中学和小学 更多的是一望无际的住宅区&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因为靠近钱塘江 这里成了房产商的狩猎地 一望无际的商品房像地毯一样 沿着钱塘江铺向天边&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;街道两侧的路灯上 也都挂满了炫目的房地产广告牌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;忽然我看见一个熟悉的 那是我在广告公司做设计练习时制作样册的楼盘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我决定骑车去实地瞧瞧 看我的作品靠不靠谱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个楼盘应该很好辨认 样册资料里有一条 钱塘江在这里拐了一道弯 三面环水&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;寻着楼盘的广告牌 沿钱塘江骑了一段 这里离大学城已经十几公里了 而江边的商品房都还没有业主入住 人迹罕至&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;树林里闪过一个人影 戴耳机的女生悠然在慢跑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不远万里从大学城一路跑到这 自行车上的我难道不应该继续前行吗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;又骑过一段 商品房排成的长龙到这里戛然而止 眼前是成片的空地 视野里最近的楼房大概还在几公里外&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;打道回府吧 这楼盘还未必就在江这边呢 想起广告公司里听到的一句话 人要懂得放弃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;汉语真是奇妙 正说反说总有理 哈哈 出来散心高兴就好 回学校！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;马上儿童节要到了 我可以理直气壮的说 我又年轻了一回&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>《世界文明史》第四讲</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/109/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2011 23:45:56 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/109/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;之前由于博客维护中 本来习惯于周二整理好的《世界文明史》也只能一拖再拖&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于这一讲的记忆也在一点点的消退 等待博客维修的过程中我每天回忆一遍 尽量减少遗忘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我上课是一点笔记也不做的 就如同人们常打的一个比方&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比尔盖茨先生看见地上有一张百元美钞 他不会弯腰去捡 因为他弯腰去捡美钞的这一点点时间 用在别处能创造出远远高于一百美元的利润&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;幸好没有等待太久 第四讲终于可以与大家见面了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;很遗憾这是最后一讲 下节课开始教授都不能亲自来讲了 只能看他的讲学视频&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天我们首先讲完古巴比伦的故事&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后打乱一下时间顺序 直接介绍文艺复兴与欧洲近现代资本主义文明的兴起和成就&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上期我们一直没有讲古巴比伦最著名的空中花园 古巴比伦三大建筑我们介绍了巴比伦城&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天来讲讲空中花园与通天塔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们如今说的古巴比伦其实包含了两个概念 从广义上讲 是古代的两河流域文明&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是从狭义上讲 是指两河流域文明的第一个政权 而成就较大的新政权称为新巴比伦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;空中花园就是新巴比伦国王尼布甲尼撒二世为妻子所建&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尼布甲尼撒二世的妻子是波斯籍的 迁居到两河流域之后 思乡成疾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尼布甲尼撒二世于是大兴土木建起了空中花园&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;空中花园并不是悬空的 只是由于植物栽培在类似如今梯田一样的阶梯上 而整体倒映在河面上显得非常高大而得名&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是建造空中花园的苦力 多数是战争的俘虏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尼布甲尼撒二世率领鼎盛时期的巴比伦文明四方征战 灭亡了犹太人的国家 犹太人在很长一段时间都沦为巴比伦人的奴隶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在犹太人圣经《旧约》中 这一段历史叫做“巴比伦之囚”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;犹太人对尼布甲尼撒二世恨之入骨 随着历史巨轮的转动 巴比伦文明已经灰飞烟灭 犹太人却存活了下来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是后世的犹太人根据圣经里的记载 百般丑化尼布甲尼撒二世 描绘成了一个半人半恶魔的生物&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-04/8.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然 历史上的尼布甲尼撒二世是很有作为的)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后我们介绍一下古巴比伦三大建筑奇迹的通天塔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;通天塔又叫做巴别塔 “巴别”是混淆的意思 这整个故事要从《圣经》说起&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自从亚当夏娃偷吃禁果之后 被上帝罚到地面 开始繁育最初的人类&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人类为了重回天堂 开始齐心协力建筑一座直通天宇的高塔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上帝见状无可奈何 心生一计 打乱了人类的语言 于是通天塔就叫做巴别塔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;互相之间语言不通 通天塔的建设就不能继续下去了 也就发展出了如今诸多民族各自完全迥异的语言&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下面我们进入第二部分 文艺复兴与欧洲近现代资本主义文明的兴起和成就&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;众所周知 文艺复兴从14世纪到17时期影响了整个欧洲&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而文艺复兴的源头就在意大利 同时意大利也是近代第一个步入资本主义社会的国家&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于意大利的故事 我们从三个关键词说起：意大利、罗马、拉丁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;意大利是我们如今广泛使用的称呼 原先只是民族的名称 久而久之也成了意大利民族所居住的国名&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;罗马是城市名字 如今的意大利首都 但这个名字的背后 有一段罗马城建城者的传奇故事&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公元前753年 罗马建城 建城者名为罗慕路斯 在古罗马人的传说中 罗慕路斯有着不寻常的三重身份&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;战神马尔斯爱上了人类女子西尔维亚 不久西尔维亚便为他生下了一对兄弟 罗慕路斯就是其中一个 所以他是神的孩子&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但我们知道神和人是不同的 西尔维亚虽然为战神怀了孕 却依然是处女&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那个年代的人们对处女有一种强烈的崇拜 所以生下小孩的处女一定不是一般人 被称作童贞女&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;耶稣的母亲圣母玛利亚同样是童贞女 可见这种处女崇拜长久影响了欧洲的诸民族&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以罗慕路斯的第二重特殊身份就是童贞女的孩子&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是童贞女西尔维亚在生下罗慕路斯时 担任着祭司的职位 在当时 祭司是不能结婚生子的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是西尔维亚被囚禁起来 两个婴儿也被扔进了河里&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;婴儿幸运的被冲上了岸边 路过的一条母狼养活了他们 所以罗慕路斯的第三重特殊身份是狼孩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果有幸去罗马旅行 至今也能看见罗马城的城徽 母狼哺育着两个婴孩的铜像&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-04/9.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;故事到这还没有结束 因为罗马的建城者是罗慕路斯 而不是他们两兄弟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两兄弟在母狼的哺育下渐渐长大 后来被一个好心人发现 带回家收养 分别起名为罗慕路斯和勒莫斯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两兄弟长大成人 推翻了暴政 决定建立一座新城&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伟业的开头往往是可笑的 罗慕路斯在地上挖了一条壕沟 然后宣布这是罗马城的城墙 胆敢跨过者必将丧命&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;勒莫斯没有意识到话中的严肃 开着玩笑从壕沟上跨了过去&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;罗慕路斯一气之下当即杀了自己的兄弟 并最终建城了一座伟大的城池 用自己的名字命名为罗马(Roma)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下面谈谈拉丁 当然拉丁和阿拉丁是没什么关系的 &lt;del&gt;.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉丁是居住在意大利的诸多民族中的一支 但是他们在语言上统一了整个意大利 古意大利的语言就是拉丁语&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉丁语如今已经发展出了多种独立的语言 统称拉丁语系&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;欧洲国家的语言主要由三种语系构成&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;东欧国家主要是斯拉夫人 俄语、保加利亚语等都属于斯拉夫语系&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;斯拉夫这个词来源于英文单词slave 主要是由于当时东欧国家的生产力都很落后 还停留在奴隶制社会&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;北欧国家最有影响力的是日耳曼民族 英语德语都属于日耳曼语系 所以我很多学外语专业的朋友告诉我说德语很好学&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;南欧的意大利语、法语、西班牙语、葡萄牙语属于拉丁语系&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;随着西班牙葡萄牙在美洲的大规模殖民活动 影响了当地的文化和语言 所以也产生了拉丁美洲这一人文概念&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过为什么文艺复兴会在意大利兴起？ 这和意大利的地理位置脱不了干系&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;欧洲的版图三面环海 历史上产生过复杂多样的文明 而地理环境极佳的地中海更是孕育文明的摇篮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;欧洲最早的古希腊文明就诞生在地中海 古罗马帝国凭借得天独厚的亚平宁半岛 盛极一时&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中世纪整个欧洲的基督教会就在意大利罗马 教会拥有一个袖珍型的国中之国——教皇国 也就是如今梵蒂冈的前身&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于紧邻地中海 古代意大利的水手是非常有名的 航行于欧洲各国之间从事商业活动&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而古代中国丝绸之路的建立 为欧洲带来了远东的文化 丝绸之路在欧洲的一端 直指地中海&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伶俐的意大利水手抓住了这个机遇 使得当时的意大利成为了整个欧洲宗教、政治、经济、文化的中心&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文艺复兴在意大利兴起也就找到了原因&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文艺复兴不得不提到的一人就是但丁 虽然历史上认为他并不生活在文艺复兴时代&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但他可以说是文艺复兴的旗手 被誉为“中世纪的最后一位诗人，同时又是新时代的最初一位诗人”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过我们重点要讲的是文艺复兴的艺术三杰——达芬奇、米开朗基罗和拉斐尔（当然是没有爱因斯坦和斯普林特的 - -||| ）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;达芬奇是一位家喻户晓的奇才 不仅在绘画艺术上有极高的造诣 也为全人类带来了科学的闪电&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;达芬奇的名画《维特鲁威人》不仅是一副精准的人体构造图 也引出了许多值得研究与争论的美学与数学问题&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-04/10.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然 达芬奇的《最后的晚餐》与《蒙娜丽莎》更有代表性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们先来看看《最后的晚餐》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-04/11.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;画面中央的是耶稣 他告诉他的十二门徒 今天你们中有一个人即将要出卖我&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;门徒们震惊了 交头接耳议论着 只有一人神色慌张&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那就是犹大 圈出来的这个人 他紧紧攥着手中的杯子 警觉地盯着耶稣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;要知道 这幅画如果创作在文艺复兴之前 不用我圈 也能明显看出哪个是犹大&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就如同犹太人丑化过的尼布甲尼撒二世一样 犹大的形象肯定是一个魔鬼或者狗头人身的邪恶生物&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而达芬奇将犹大画成一个活生生的人 有血有肉有情绪 将人类的文化艺术带入了一个写实主义的时代&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这种现实的绘画风格在《蒙娜丽莎》上也得以体现&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-04/12.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这幅画被认为最美的部位就是这双手 真实细腻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再请细看蒙娜丽莎右眼旁边的蝴蝶斑 写实主义的达芬奇不仅将美的一面描绘出来 瑕疵也毫不掩饰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而经过后人查证 画中这位人物脸上的蝴蝶斑确有其事 这是一位怀孕的妇人&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文艺复兴艺术三杰的另一位艺术大师米开朗基罗 他的杰作我们也不陌生——大卫像&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;米开朗基罗在绘画、雕塑、建筑艺术上都有非凡的成就&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其中雕塑最为人们所颂扬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大卫像高4.342米 以一名意大利模特原样按比例放大 表现成年男子人体之美&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;结构匀称自然 细节清晰 皮肤下的血管都如实表现出来 是写实主义在雕塑艺术上最好的诠释&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;相比以上两位 拉斐尔在三杰中的领域就窄的多 但他的成就也一样举足轻重&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉斐尔毕生都致力于绘画艺术 尤其是圣母像&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.victor42.work/posts/2011-02/02-04/13.jpg"
loading="lazy"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉斐尔一反圣母玛利亚神圣庄严的形象&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;将圣母玛利亚的形象平民化 变成亲切美丽的凡人母亲&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;图中怀抱婴儿的就是玛利亚 婴儿就是耶稣了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;注意看玛利亚的脸上泛着幸福的红晕&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个普通母亲的美被拉斐尔描绘的淋漓尽致&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉斐尔的各种版本圣母像都是这种风格&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现实主义在他的手中渗入到了宗教作品中&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文艺复兴影响了整个欧洲 直到大文豪莎士比亚时代之后结束&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不仅文化与艺术 全欧洲的政治经济在文艺复兴的几个世纪中也得到了长足发展&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是为什么如今的欧洲 意大利却不是发达国家 甚至在欧洲算经济落后的国家&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在历史不同时期都有各种不同的重大原因&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其中一个重大原因就是与东方文明的联系被切断&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文艺复兴之后 奥斯曼土耳其帝国逐渐壮大 占领了地中海东岸的大片地区 切断了丝绸之路&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而土耳其帝国是伊斯兰民族 格格不入的宗教导致了经济与文化上的封锁 从此欧洲与东方文明的陆上联系被切断&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是意大利的地理位置不再具有优势 经验丰富的意大利水手转战葡萄牙和西班牙 努力在海上开拓通往东方的路线&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从此葡萄牙与西班牙两个国家 凭借地中海咽喉的地理优势 依靠航海业迅速崛起 在各大洲都开拓了殖民地&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当时人们普遍相信天圆地方说 认为地是方形的 而天是一个无比巨大的半圆穹顶罩在地上&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以去东方只有两条海路 一是北上过通过北冰洋 然而北冰洋常年冰冻 船只无法航行&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以只有走第二条航线 向南绕过非洲大陆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;葡萄牙航海家迪亚斯1488年到达了非洲的最南端 前面风浪大作 于是他将此地命名为风暴角&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回国之后 葡王约翰二世将风暴角重新命名为好望角 意在指前方出现一片新的大洋 到达东方有望了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在葡萄牙作出重大发现的同时 西班牙在航海上却显得苍白无力 但时隔不久 机遇来了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一名意大利水手来到葡萄牙 游说葡萄牙王室发起新航线的探索&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他认为地并不是方的 而是圆的 所以在理论上存在到东方的第三条航线 他就是如今家喻户晓的哥伦布&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是这个提议被葡萄牙王室拒绝了 于是哥伦布来到西班牙 却得到了西班牙王室的高度重视&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;西班牙王室迅速为他筹备了船队与一切探索设施 并与哥伦布立下字据 任何发现的非基督教地区 哥伦布都担任总督&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就这样哥伦布起航了 他坚信大地是一个球体 向西航行可以到达东方&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在成吉思汗时代之后 由于丝绸之路的长期中断 欧洲人已经不知道中华民族的存在了 他们所谓的东方就是指印度&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但从我们今天看来 从西班牙去印度 向西航行要横穿大西洋和太平洋两个大洋 显然是一条很远的航线&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里插一句题外话 太平洋这个名字的来源&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另一位航海家麦哲伦从西班牙出发 发现了麦哲伦海峡 而海峡的另一边出现了一个比大西洋还辽阔的大洋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当时眼前风平浪静 麦哲伦便很高兴的将它命名为太平洋 现在我们知道他是被表象骗了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们话说回来 虽然哥伦布是较早意识到大地是个球体的人之一 但是他的计算出现了失误 将地球的实际大小算小了很多&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以他认为从西班牙到印度 向西走是一条比较短的途径 正是这个错误坚定了他向西探索的信心&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;哥伦布的船队向西航行 却并没有在预想的时间中发现大陆 水手们都开始质疑哥伦布的计算&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是哥伦布当场重新计算了一次 用他错误的数据与错误的方法重新计算 结果依然是错误的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他说服水手们 既然已经航行到这么远了 何不再继续前行 再给他三天时间 没有任何发现就返航&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;哥伦布的运气非常好 就在第三天的早晨 值班的水手嗅到了泥土的气息 哥伦布向远处望去 果然发现一片黑压压的大陆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;船队到达印度的消息立马在水手之间炸开 但今天的我们知道 哥伦布发现的其实是美洲&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;部分证据说明 美洲印第安人是商朝时期从亚洲迁徙过去的 但是这还有待考证&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有人发现了印第安人这个名称的一种解释 中国的商朝也称作殷 在美洲与世隔绝生活了许久的印第安人以为中国还是商朝&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有外来人到达美洲 他们就急切的询问“殷地安？” 所以就把他们称作印第安人&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然这只是个文字游戏 这里再讲一个更高超的文字游戏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二战爆发不久 一位欧洲商人在纽约机场等待飞机 由于时间充裕 他就在纽约街头闲逛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;街边有一人声称自己可以预知未来 商人好奇便问他 你预知一下这场战争最后谁胜利&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这人便开始在纸上写名字&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mussolini（墨索里尼）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitler（希特勒）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chamberlain（张伯伦，二战期间英国首相）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daladier（达拉第，与张伯伦同时期的法国总理，两者都是妥协绥靖政府的代表）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;商人沉默不语 算命人说 他们谁都没赢 而是每行的第三个字母竖着读 stalin（斯大林）才是最后的赢家&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;扯的好像有点远了 不过至少可以说明一点&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当年的哥伦布把同样黄棕色皮肤的印第安人当作印度人了 并抓了几个“印度人”带回西班牙以证明他发现了印度&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;随后西方列强开始大规模海外殖民 成立了东印度公司和西印度公司 西印度就是指美洲的印第安人居住地&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;西班牙和葡萄牙人的船队带着四个“G”四处征战 前面提到的拉丁美洲的概念也随着他们的殖民活动而产生&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这四个“G”分别代表：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.God 上帝的信仰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;基督教徒都有传教的义务 这和犹太教是不同的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;犹太教信仰的是《旧约》 在《旧约》中 上帝派摩西与所有的犹太人订下契约 虔诚信仰上帝的犹太人在末日审判的时候可以进入天堂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以犹太教是不传教的 即便其他民族信仰犹太教 死后一样进不了天堂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而基督教信仰《新约》 摩西与犹太人订盟之后 上帝又派耶稣来与全世界人订盟约 降福于全人类&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;既然这个契约是与全人类订的 基督教徒们就有义务将上帝的福泽带给所有尚未信仰上帝的民族&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.Gold 经济的掠夺&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;殖民必然伴随着经济的掠夺 殖民地的产品被成批运往本土 而殖民地的人民也直接或间接的沦为了奴隶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.Glory 骑士的荣耀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当时的欧洲各国多信奉一种骑士精神 骑士精神的精髓在忠、勇二字&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;骑士阶层是中世纪欧洲一个特殊的阶层 他们通常隶属于贵族领主 而领主外出的时候 就向领主的夫人尽忠&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后来逐渐就演变成了绅士对待女性的一种态度&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而勇字 在探索未知的大海、踏平新的土地上 能够得到充分的体现&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.Gun 先进的枪炮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;虽然火药是中国发明的 但是运用到战争上 欧洲人占了先机&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当时的葡萄牙西班牙已经发展出了火力强劲射速快精度高的枪炮了 而美洲的玛雅、阿兹特克等等民族还停留在冷兵器时代&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>《世界文明史》第三讲</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/107/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2011 23:45:17 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/107/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;这节课我们继续探寻两河流域文明的秘密&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上节课我们讲到&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;亚述(Asu)就是指两河流域一带地区 文明总是沿着河流兴起的 何况是两条河之间水草丰美的平原&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;事实上人类最早的文明就是这里的苏美尔人创建的 距今5500年的历史 而古埃及文明距今5200 比亚述文明晚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而罗马城的建立 在公元前753年 更是比苏美尔人晚的多&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;亚述以南的一片地区叫做巴比伦尼亚 环绕着巴比伦城 阿卡德人与苏美尔人居住在这里&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阿卡德人与苏美尔人携手推翻了亚述帝国 建立了真正意义上的两河流域文明 也就是众所周知的巴比伦王朝&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;巴比伦人对人类的发展做出了不可磨灭的贡献&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;早在公元前3000年以前 巴比伦人就开始使用十进制与六十进制计数&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十进制如今已经为全世界广泛使用 而这个六十进制是做什么用的呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;智慧的古巴比伦人使用六十进制来划分一个圆并丈量一切事物的角度 一个圆就是6个六十进制数&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而且巴比伦人也是最早将六十进制应用到时间的计算上 一分钟60秒 一小时60分钟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上期我们提到过 伊斯兰国家的天文历法都是阴历 以月亮盈亏为一月来计算时间&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一周为一个月的四分之一 约为七天&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;星期一在英文中叫做Monday 这里的Mon就是moon 所以一周是从月亮开始的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;经历火、水、木、金、土五大行星 然后以太阳结束 周末就是Sunday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于这种星期系统 日语的翻译比较到位&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在日语与韩语中 星期一到星期日分别称为月曜日、火曜日、水曜日……日曜日&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而我们中国人常说的礼拜天 是一种误解 Sunday是礼拜天并不是因为单词里有个day 而是基督教徒们这天要做礼拜&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而在伊斯兰国家和犹太教国家 礼拜日却分别是星期六与星期五 所以礼拜天在不同的宗教里 是不同的时间&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过为什么是从月亮开始呢？ 因为在炎热的中东以及北非 人民对太阳并没有什么特殊的感情&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;反而对月亮情有独钟 所以一切神圣的事物都是和月亮有关的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;诸多伊斯兰国家的国旗上都有月亮图形 而且我们平时常说的红十字会 在伊斯兰国家就不这么说&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他们的慈善机构叫做红新月会 旗帜由一轮新月与一颗闪烁的星星构成&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而在犹太教国家 慈善机构的标志常常是一颗六芒星 六芒星在犹太教中有特别的意义 也被他们称为大卫王之盾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于当今世界最具有影响力的 大都是基督教国家 所以我们中国这样的无神论国家 也将慈善机构称为红十字会&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除去在数学与天文历法上的贡献 古巴比伦人也曾一度将建筑艺术推到了顶峰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;众所周知的巴比伦空中花园 当然它并不是真正悬在空中的 这只是一个翻译上的错误&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外巴比伦人建立起人类史上最早的城邦国家 以一座城及周边地区为国家&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;巴比伦城也是一项伟大的杰作 四方形的巴比伦城的一条城墙长度为24公里 整个巴比伦城的面积达到了570多平方公里&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是个什么概念呢？ 如今最小的国家梵蒂冈 只有0.44平方公里 相当于一个天安门广场大小&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里顺便提一下方丈和尚这个称呼的来源&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有一种和尚 他们住的房间是标准的边长一丈正方形 他们住的房间叫做方丈室 后来逐渐演变成对人的称呼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如此宏伟的一座城池 以当时的文明程度来说的确是一项壮举&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;城墙的墙角涂有沥青 为了抵御两河的泛滥 巴比伦城当时常在汛期被作为囤积粮食与避难的场所&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;遇到战争 可调动城内的水系淹没护城河&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外古巴比伦还建立了人类历史上第一座图书馆 这个我们在下面会讲到&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下面我们来谈谈巴比伦人在政治上的贡献&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;《爱在西元前》里那句耳熟能详的歌词“古巴比伦王颁布了汉莫拉比法典”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;汉莫拉比法典之所以如此著名 因为它是世上第一部保存完好的法典&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但人类所发现的最早的法典却不是这一部 而是乌尔纳木法典&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;纳木是当时的一位国王 乌尔是他统治的王国的名字 为了与其他叫纳木的人区别开 所以称作乌尔纳木法典&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里不得不提一下 古人的名字不像现在的穆罕默德·阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·阿卜杜勒·拉乌夫·库杜阿·侯赛尼(即阿拉法特)这么一长串&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一直到很晚 人们才有姓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比如达芬奇 其实这个名字并不是在说他本人&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他名叫莱昂纳多 没有姓 居住在芬奇镇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是他的画很有名 人们为了将他与其他的莱昂纳多区别开 将他称为莱昂纳多·达·芬奇 这个达就是“的”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以这个名字的意思是：芬奇镇的那个莱昂纳多&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而我们中国人的名字更特殊 除了姓、名 还有字&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;姓名是父母给的 比如毛泽东 字润之 润之两字是他自己起的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是只有他的父辈们能叫他毛泽东 作为尊称只能称呼为毛润之先生&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;新中国成立之后 由于所有人都称呼他为毛主席 字也就没有用了 也就从那时候 名和字才合为一体了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那么乌尔纳木法典也是这样 是乌尔城的纳木王颁布的法典&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过由于乌尔纳木法典如今只留下了一些残片 完整度比较低 所以不如汉莫拉比法典著名&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所谓法典 就是最早出现的成文法律 是古巴比伦人用楔形文字刻在泥版上的法律条文&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们上期提到的古埃及文明 他们的象形文字是写在一种天然的草纸上的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而巴比伦的楔形文字是用工具刻在泥版上的 两河流域的土质类似于我国的黄土高原 风干后质地坚硬能长久保存&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以我国黄土高原上的人民普遍住在窑洞中 佛像造在窑洞里就成了石窟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而南方的土质是建不成石窟的 所以南方多见的都是庙宇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;刚才提到的古巴比伦图书馆就是这样一座存放成千上百刻有楔形文字泥版的建筑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过那时的图书不像如今的图书 印刷术还没出现 完全由人工篆刻的泥版无法出版 所以更确切的说法应该是古巴比伦档案馆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;里面保存记载着法典、天文历法、地理与很多与生活息息相关的细枝末节 甚至详细到某种药酒的配方&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;档案馆的文献分门别类排列有序 古人的图书管理工作就已经做的非常到位了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下面是汉莫拉比法典的实物图&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;注意看泥版顶部 画中左边站着的是汉莫拉比 而右边坐着的是神 神正伸手把自己的权杖赐给汉莫拉比&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整副画的含义就是 这部法典并不是汉莫拉比王的意志 而是神的意志 违反法典的人也就违背了神&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以“法律是神圣的”这个概念在古巴比伦时期就出现了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;神圣一词 在此就可以解释为神授权的 而在我们无神论的中国 这个词还真不是那么好解释&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在基督教伊斯兰教与犹太教中 婚姻一样是神圣的 它的起源可以追溯到上帝造人&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;《圣经》中上帝造人的故事在《古兰经》中也是一样的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上帝造了亚当 却发现亚当一人活在世上非常孤独非常痛苦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是趁亚当睡着时 从他胸前抽取一根肋骨造了夏娃 这样有了最初的人类男女&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是上帝在造亚当之前 还造了一个生物 那就是撒旦 他不是人也不是神 应该称为精灵&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上帝在造了亚当之后 要求撒旦向亚当下跪表示尊敬 撒旦十分不满 于是上帝决定将撒旦投入地狱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;撒旦十分惊恐的从命了 于是上帝决定在末日审判的时候再将撒旦投入地狱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;撒旦一心想着报复亚当 于是引诱亚当吃世界之树上的禁果&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;题外话：我们中国人造字其实也是很有技巧的 这个“禁”字刚好就像世界之树之下的告示牌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;亚当忠于上帝 并没有受到撒旦的诱惑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是撒旦去说服夏娃 夏娃很快就被说动 贪婪的吃下了禁果&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;题外话：无巧不成书 这个“婪”字刚好描绘了夏娃在世界之树下偷吃禁果的场面&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;亚当为了不让夏娃一人被投入地狱 只得自己也吃下了禁果&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以在《古兰经》中的世界观有人类原罪说 人类生来就是犯罪的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而伊斯兰人将主要的罪归咎于夏娃 他们认为女人不仅容易犯罪 而且容易诱使男人犯罪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以这便是伊斯兰国家妇女地位低的原因之一&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;古代阿拉伯男人长期在外 不是打仗就是经商 为了防止家中的妻子红杏出墙 于是形成了这样的风俗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阿拉伯妇女不得让自己丈夫以外的男人看到自己任何一个有女性特征的部位 连头发也不能有一丝露在外面 只露出两只眼睛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而且阿拉伯妇女的装束通常都是水桶型 这样男人便无法从身材辨认出性别&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然 除了这些宗教与道德观念的原因 自然环境也造就了阿拉伯民族特殊的装束&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宽松的大袍子内部通风良好 是天然的空调 全身包裹的严严实实能有效抵御阳光和风沙&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好了 今天的课就到这里 下周是清明节 大家两周后再见吧&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>《世界文明史》第二讲</title><link>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/103/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2011 23:43:59 +0000</pubDate><author>greenzorromail@gmail.com (Victor42)</author><guid>https://victor42.eth.limo/post/103/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;有人会问 第一讲哪去了呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好吧~~~ 我自首&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一讲的时候 我为了赚那么几个小钱 没去 严重的智障了一回啊！！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;浙江大学的计翔翔教授主讲 我们这个鸟不拉屎的学校蓬荜生辉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我决定每周这样做一次笔记 翘专业课也要去听！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;咳咳！ 下面 《世界文明史》第二讲开讲！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一讲大致内容是古埃及文明的兴起&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本期我们来探讨一下古埃及的科学成就&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;古埃及文明在医学和天文历法方面的贡献不可磨灭&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尤其是天文历法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从儒略历到我们如今所用的公历&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其中的故事待我细细道来&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;埃及人所用的天文历法称为太阳历&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以太阳公转一周为精确的一年 一年分为12个月 每月平均30或31天 大月小月交替轮换&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;到了罗马帝国兴起 凯撒独裁时期&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;凯撒花重金去埃及请来一位天文学家为罗马制定历法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;埃及的天文历法传入了罗马 尽管古埃及文明没落了 天文历法却随着人类文明的兴衰一步步走到了现在&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于太阳历每年有11分钟左右的误差&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;罗马人将每年减少一天 配合四年一闰年的规则 大大缩小了误差&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而减去的这一天 定在每年处决犯人的2月&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;凯撒在元老院遇害之后 罗马人为了纪念他 将7月定为凯撒月&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;凯撒名叫Julius 以古语的翻译习惯译为“儒略” 这个历法也称为儒略历 所以我们如今的七月就叫做July&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之后凯撒的养子屋大维领导罗马人民 他逝世之后 罗马人民为了纪念他 将他逝世的8月命名为Augustus（奥古斯都）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;和July一样 八月便称作August&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;屋大维对罗马人的贡献 甚至超过了凯撒 以至于罗马帝国后来的两位皇帝同时当政时期 主皇帝称作奥古斯都 副皇帝才称为凯撒&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为了颂扬屋大维对罗马的贡献 人们将8月增加一天 改为大月&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9月减一天 10月加一天 11月减一天 12月加一天&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如此一年减了2天加了3天 多出的那一天照旧在2月扣除&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这套历法也被称作罗马历&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;虽然罗马帝国最终被淹没在历史的长河中 罗马历后来却被基督教会采用 古埃及人的天文历法得以延续&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;基督教会的分裂与北欧民族的入侵 使得庞大的罗马帝国土崩瓦解 分裂为东西两个国家&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两个罗马帝国在信仰上产生了分歧 罗马教皇将教会改名为天主教 而君士坦丁堡的教皇将教会改名为东正教&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;东正教至今都沿用了儒略历&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而天主教对罗马历进行了进一步的修改&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;罗马教皇格利高里十三派人修改历法 发现这一年的春分偏离了十三天 经过演算 证实了儒略历每400年就会产生3天的偏差&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是这一年减去了13天 并规定每到××00年 凡能被400整除的才算闰年&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这套历法就是如今国际通用的公历 也是世上最精确的天文历法 每1000年才会产生一天左右的误差&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以基督教徒们其实每年都可以过两个圣诞节&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12月25日去罗马过天主教的圣诞节 1月6日在圣彼得堡还能过上东正教的圣诞节&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除此之外 俄国十月革命发生在11月也是由于阴历与阳历的时间差导致的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而对于我国的农历 也广泛被大家称为阴历 则是一种完全不同的历法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阴历以月亮一盈亏计算时间 一年12个月 弯月为朔 圆月为望 望朔一轮回为一个月&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但其实我国所用的历法严格上并不能称作阴历&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;真正的阴历是伊斯兰教徒们所用的历法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;穆斯林们的阴历 会产生较大的偏差 所以他们一年往往有13个月&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伊斯兰国家的春节常常会倒退 甚至会发生在夏天&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而我国的农历 是阳历和阴历的结合&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在月的天数上做适当的调整 使得农历的节日能稳定在一个月前后而不会发生大幅度的提前&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;农历能精确描述一年中的节气变化 是专为农耕制定出的天文历法&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;课间休息~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下面我们来讲第二章 两河流域文明&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;众所周知&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两河流域指的是幼发拉底河和底格里斯河中间的平原 也就是如今的伊拉克和叙利亚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;优越的地理环境是孕育民族的摇篮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;欧洲人将两河流域称为亚述（Asu） 而亚述以东的地区就称为亚细亚（Asia）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然而这个地区的民族自古都不能长久&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;夹在地中海、黑海、波斯湾、红海中央 连接欧亚大陆的交通要道 向来都是兵家必争之地&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;加上两河流域平原无险可守 于是这里历史上经历过许多次易手&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;先后被波斯人、希腊人、罗马人、阿拉伯人、土耳其人统治过&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如今的地中海东部沿岸被欧洲人称为近东 两河流域与巴尔干半岛一带被称为中东 再远处称为远东&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而我们所常说的西方世界 是指两河流域以西的欧亚国家和美洲&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于古时没用七大洲的概念 而近东国家大多信奉基督教 所以根据宗教划分到西方国家的范畴&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为何美洲算是西方世界？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;美国与加拿大等美洲国家算是欧洲的女儿 如今的许多中美洲国家的国旗国徽上还有英国米字旗的元素&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在美国 主流社会由白人新教徒组成 他们大都带着安格鲁萨克森人的血统&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;安格鲁人原本居住在德国北部瑞典以南的半岛地带 被波罗的海环绕形成一个突出的角 而安格鲁（angle）正是角的意思&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;安格鲁人后来跨越了海洋来到了如今的英国 将此地命名为Angleland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于语言的发展 Angleland逐渐简化为England&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;萨克森人与安格鲁人一样 属于日耳曼人的一支 两个长期混居的民族共同构成了如今的英国人种&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不难看出 美国是英国的女儿 只是这女儿出嫁之后活的比娘家滋润的多&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如此 两河流域穿越了数千年的风雨 积淀了数千年的故事 成了如今东西方文明的分界线&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今天的课就到这里 我们下周一继续探索神秘的两河流域……&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
