We often work towards retirement, or at least escaping *this* job. But individuals and society are intertwined in a dance of giving and taking. Imagine society viewing your life. It might look like this:

Before your 20s, you mostly take, not give. Your parents provide most of this, but society also contributes through public services. From your 20s until retirement, you start giving back more, while still taking, but less. After retirement, giving decreases, eventually returning to mostly taking.

Money is merely a proxy. The real exchange between people and society involves labor, services, and even intangible contributions.

In an ideal, fair society, your lifetime giving and taking should balance out. During your working years, you naturally give more than you take. This is why we get tired, feel underappreciated, and yearn for early retirement. It's normal – it's how the equation works. It's not a midlife crisis or a societal flaw.

But that's society's perspective; individuals may have other priorities. The personal goal is often to retire ASAP. It's not about idleness, but about reaching your lifetime giving quota sooner, gaining options. So, early retirement hinges on: how do you maximize your giving efficiency?

Around 35, you've likely gained expertise. That's the sweet spot to boost your giving efficiency. As a pioneer, you might nudge your industry forward. As a manager, you could elevate your team's output to (or beyond) your own. Entrepreneurs create entirely new industries, with potentially massive efficiency gains.

Of course, some might save, buy properties, and open a small store. Their contribution is roughly equivalent to a dozen rentals and supplying local groceries. Value is subjective, but most would agree on the relative impact of these two scenarios.

"But I just don't want to work anymore!" I get it. I often gripe about my job too. But does work always equal giving? Some jobs seem busy but offer little real value, actually hindering progress. Conversely, some people don't "work" traditionally, yet create immense value, like through investing.

Thinking of investing as passive income is simplistic. Whether it's a bank deposit or stocks, that money fuels a business or individual. They use it to grow, boosting their contribution to society. As an outsider, trying to replicate that yourself would likely fail. By simply transferring the funds, you've increased overall giving and receive a share of the value.

Let the experts do their thing. For most, excelling in your field is the best way to boost giving efficiency. If you're averse to the labor, support other professionals, helping them create value, ultimately contributing to society.

In short, retirement shouldn't be about becoming a couch potato, secretly freeloading off society. It should be about confidently saying, "I've given back significantly, and I've earned a break." Of course, you might find you don't *want* that break when it arrives, but that's a different story.
