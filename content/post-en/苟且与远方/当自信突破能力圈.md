Typically, confidence grows alongside competence, and often lags behind it. You need a solid foundation of skills before feeling confident. But sometimes, your confidence outstrips your competence, making you fearless in new situations. I've experienced this twice since graduating:

First, a few years back, I took adult spoken English classes at New Oriental. It was awesome. My English education in school was decent, giving me a good base. I passed CET-6 in college without studying, scoring 504. But test scores don't equal confidence. I mostly used Chinese, and my English was limited to reading and writing. Reading English news felt like a major undertaking.

At New Oriental, I spent over six months chatting with teachers and classmates in English, covering all sorts of topics. Most of the grammar was review, and I'd forgotten much of the vocabulary. I probably haven't retained much of the actual English learned. However, my confidence skyrocketed. I could effortlessly type in English to search for information and read long articles without feeling overwhelmed. It wasn't about understanding everything perfectly; I still needed a dictionary, but it felt natural. As a direct result, my English improved significantly after the course.

Second, when I started working with AI. My coding skills were mediocre. I'm a designer, not a coder. At a friend's suggestion, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (though my JavaScript was basic) to build my website. Once the site was live, I didn't consider using code for other problems. I'd search for existing tools, and if none existed, I'd give up.

After learning basic Python with AI's help, my confidence soared again. I became bolder. Now, when facing a problem, my first thought is often: "Let's write a program with AI to solve this."

Today, I was organizing prompt words for AI image generation. I have categorized notes. Terms like "knolling," "isometric drawing," and "Dutch shot" describe specific effects, which are key for getting the desired results from AI. But sometimes, I want a visual comparison of these effects. This meant searching for each term individually.

Today, I tackled this. The goal: combine the terms, separated by commas, and with one click, open multiple browser tabs for image searches of each term.

With AI's assistance, I wrote a working script in 2 minutes. Another 10 minutes went into refining it, handling edge cases, and improving extensibility. From problem to solution, it took under 15 minutes. Crucially, this was outside my competence zone.

When your confidence exceeds your competence, your skills quickly catch up, because knowledge and action are intertwined. In learning, building confidence is more vital than the amount learned.

It's an exciting time to be alive. There are countless ways to boost your confidence beyond your competence and solve real-world problems. I'm not just referring to AI; seeking professional help or even purchasing services (with careful selection) can work, provided you're willing to take that initial step.
