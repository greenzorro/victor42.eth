I had the craziest dream.

I woke up as a kid, stuck in a space hotel in synchronous orbit. Outside, I could see a huge, unfamiliar planet, cyan like Uranus, with air currents streaking across its surface. The hotel was huge, with every amenity imaginable. The staff and guests were friendly and helped me get by. But nobody could tell me where we were. Everyone just called it "the hotel." Asking about the year got me blank stares – they didn't even know what a "year" was.

Days became weeks, and as I explored, the mystery deepened. I found a small library and an observatory. I taught myself basic math, astronomy, and observation. It took ages, but I found pulsars and variable stars to use as beacons. Finally, I pinpointed our location: 91,000 light-years from the solar system, on the Milky Way's far side. It was 5 billion years in the future. The sun had gone red giant, swallowing most of the solar system, including Earth.

With that, I finally understood. Everyone, like me, came from lost civilizations. I could see their true forms, and they were bizarre – if you could even call them "people." There was a self-tying towel and a plasma ball making dolphin sounds. A mysterious, advanced civilization had preserved our memories, letting us live here in our original forms. The space hotel was actually a museum.

I borrowed the hotel's biggest cinema and presented my findings. Some were silent, some were fascinated. Most, of course, burst into tears... if that's what you'd call the strange things these creatures suddenly started doing.
