It started with a simple task: design an icon for "Operations." We're a recruiting company, and we needed a visual. Representing an abstract concept with a concrete image is tricky – lots of choices, but nothing feels perfect.

So, I went back to basics. What's the core message? I've worked with Ops for ages, but did I really understand their role?

As a product designer, I don't interact with Ops much. It always seemed, well, *diverse*. That was my vague impression. Some visual designers? They view Ops as unreliable, inconsistent, even contradictory, ignoring branding and pushing things on users. I can recall almost every time a designer I've worked with has vented; Ops is usually high on the list.

Of course, it's simplistic to stereotype. My girlfriend interviewed at a startup. The CEO, in the final round, discussed her hobby, ancient Chinese history, and her pragmatic nature. He was surprised. "How can a designer be like you? Aren't they all artsy? Concerts and museums?" I was shocked too. How far can such a narrow-minded CEO lead?

You can't pigeonhole people or professions. You'll miss valuable learning opportunities. You have to assume that true Ops professionals aren't like that. I researched and talked to my Ops colleagues. It was my first real attempt to understand their work – and yes, it's *very* diverse.

Operations can be split into three areas: content, user, and campaign. All are equally vital. My take:

- Content Operations: Creating and maintaining content.
- User Operations: Focusing on user behavior, guiding it towards business goals.
- Campaign Operations: Creating growth opportunities through planning and resource integration.

Channel, community, and new media operations are categorized by medium. The specific tasks depend on the medium.

"Operations" comes from "Operate," as in COO. "Operate" usually means to control. I liked an online analogy: If product and design build the ship, operations sails it. It's a fundamental difference in mindset. Shipbuilders use static thinking: How's the structure? Ideal state? Wind resistance? Sailors *must* use dynamic thinking: What if currents shift? Suez Canal or Cape of Good Hope? Shipbuilders *can* use dynamic thinking, but they can still function without it. Sailors constantly face change. Only the destination is fixed.

This is my first team with such specialized Ops roles. Seeing the business through their eyes has been eye-opening. It began with a design review debate.

We were redesigning our mobile site – a visual refresh, mainly. Functionality wasn't the focus. Homepage requirements: "Emphasize search, de-emphasize the banner." I agreed initially. Job seekers want efficiency, not browsing. Search is key. So, I proposed this:

The search box is larger, with a shadow for emphasis, visually dominating the banner. Mission accomplished. The 2x3 grid of job recommendations below is essentially searches for those keywords. Placing the search box nearby could transform "recommended jobs" into "popular searches," broadening search's scope.

The product manager loved it, but Ops objected *strongly*. I explained the benefits, but Ops couldn't accept the banner being obscured. The PM surprisingly joined in, arguing fiercely with Ops. Their stances were clear: Product prioritized efficiency and minimal distractions; Operations wanted a vibrant feel and rich content. As designers, where did *we* stand?

How do we see banners? Annoying, mostly. Often irrelevant, space-consuming, and visually jarring. Many PMs likely agree. They see it as Ops' domain, something to ignore. If Ops wants a say, give them a banner and let them handle it. I've thought that way myself.

PMs and product designers are usually rational, logical, efficiency-driven. It's the job. As an engineer and pragmatist, I believe a good product sells itself. Perfect it, and growth follows. That's not wrong, but if you think Ops-driven projects are less intelligent, mere grunt work, you're mistaken.

The search box debate ended inconclusively, the design killed by a majority vote. But, something Ops said near the end resonated:

"We use this banner for partnerships, resource swaps. People will say, 'It's not prominent. It's on the homepage, but blocked.' We can't offer that."

We could've solved the blocking. The point is, did we, designers and PMs, ever *care* about Ops' needs? Did we consider their role in the bigger picture?

Many companies succeed through refined products. Sketch is an example. But not every industry has that level of technical depth or differentiation. The more grounded the industry, the tougher that path. Ruthless expansion, dominating the market – that's another, winner-takes-all strategy.

Our team is in that kind of industry, and our strength is Operations. So, why not play to our strengths? I often face situations against my design principles. I follow Ops' lead, using design to achieve their goals, but we find a balance. Alignment is more crucial than individual principles.

What *is* product design? It's not so lofty. Designers have a mental scale, measuring user experience. A slight shift can turn a well-meaning nudge into manipulative, brand-damaging dark patterns. We warn against that, but it rarely reaches that point. We represent users, defending their interests. But the foundation is helping the company profit. On that, we and Ops are aligned.

So, these colleagues deserve design support. Create unique elements for their diverse display needs. Track and improve metrics for their monetization needs. Establish guidelines for their partnership needs. Shift your perspective, and you'll see your work is still valuable.

Back to the icon: What represents "Operations"? I drew a simple bar chart: X and Y axes, two bars, one taller. It's abstract, and Ops' work varies greatly, but business growth is the shared goal.

If we don't understand the sailors, how can we build a good ship?
