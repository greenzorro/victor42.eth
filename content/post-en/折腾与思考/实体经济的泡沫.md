Bright Dairy's Ubest milk boasts 180mg of immunoglobulin per liter. Whoever came up with that, Bright Dairy's staff or some marketing firm, is a genius—a twisted one, maybe.

First time I saw this ad, I wasn't sure if it was meant to be drunk or injected. Seriously, why not add some Hepatitis B immunoglobulin to infant formula? My daughter could skip a shot.

Who are they kidding? Does everything you swallow magically enter your bloodstream? They're betting that people will buy into that. And it works, doesn't it?

Bright Dairy is playing it smart. You can't nail them for false advertising. They don't claim any immune benefits, just that they added something harmless. Someone complains? They'll just say, "You assumed it had immune benefits? That's on you."

I could do the same. I'll sell Erguotou (a type of Chinese liquor) in a fancy bottle. Pure grain, perfect alcohol content, great for cleaning screens. Buy it!

See? Nothing changed. I just created a bogus niche market with some clever wording. Throw money at marketing, make it stick. Competitors will jump in, hype it up even more. All that capital and labor, wasted.

Don't think the real economy is actually "real." This deceptive over-packaging *is* its bubble. Real estate and financial bubbles are huge, interconnected, and earth-shattering when they burst. The real economy's bubbles seem small, isolated. But when consumption drops, these markets will collapse even faster, fueling volatility. Just look at those ridiculous ads in elevators. Are these bubbles really smaller than real estate or finance, considering the consumer market's size?

When an avalanche happens, it's not just the snow at the top; it's the whole mountainside.
