What a ridiculous dream. 

一个很荒唐的梦。

In a parallel universe, 1914, the World War One didn't happen, or to be exact, didn't happen that way. The world was tightly united as one, under the governance of an orgnization called Internet alliance led by a couple of giant companies.Those behemoths were refered to as THE BIG A back then.

平行世界中的1914年，第一次世界大战没有发生，或者不像我们的世界里那样发生。一个叫做英特网联盟的组织在统治着全球，它由一些巨头企业构成，全世界紧密联系，融为一体。当时，这些庞然大物被人们称为“联盟”。

As time went by, a few of the leading companies started to invade in each other's business empire. Tension arose. The politicians relied on the data and algorithms so much that they couldn't do anything.

随时间推移，少数领军企业开始入侵彼此的商业帝国，局势趋于紧张。政客们过于依赖数据和算法，无法对科技公司做出任何实质干预。

Eventually, the alliance was cracked into two camps sending out troops to destroy each other's data centers. Biplanes were fighting above cities all day, bombing almost everything.

最终，联盟瓦解成两大阵营。双方派遣军队，试图摧毁对方的数据中心。城市上空，双翼机漫天盘旋，地面都是残垣断壁。

Historians in that universe call it THE TECH IMPLOSION.

在这个平行世界中，后世的历史学家将这一时期称为：科技内爆。
