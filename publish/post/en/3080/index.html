<p>I&rsquo;ve had a reflective year. Being a designer is hard, and I felt stagnant, which was disheartening. But I also learned some key lessons about self-improvement. This year, I&rsquo;m acting on them to break through. And I&rsquo;m sharing them with fellow design enthusiasts:</p>
<h3 id="1-share-and-share-alike">1. Share and Share Alike</h3>
<p>Sharing is the first step. Explaining what you know is a review process. It doesn&rsquo;t instantly grant new skills, but it lets you slow down and truly grasp the core concepts.</p>
<p>A friend asked how to improve color sense and matching. I was initially stumped. Color is tricky. Finally, I suggested paying attention to everyday colors ‚Äì packaging, cookbooks, clothes, ads. Try recalling them; the details will fade, leaving only the key colors. That&rsquo;s the essence of color matching. Also, study photography and monochromatic designs. Same idea. I surprised myself with that answer. Had I used these methods? On reflection, I had, but I&rsquo;d only just realized it.</p>
<p>Answering her question helped me summarize a key design skill. The benefits of sharing are often subtle, things you won&rsquo;t find in books. Don&rsquo;t miss them.</p>
<h3 id="2-work-hard-network-harder">2. Work Hard, Network Harder</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not overly talkative, but I&rsquo;m not an introvert either. I make friends, but I don&rsquo;t actively expand my circle. I value my close friends, but I&rsquo;m not driven to meet new people. This is a drawback for a designer. Design isn&rsquo;t solitary; it&rsquo;s about understanding others. Designers need to connect, especially with peers.</p>
<p>After my article, <a class="link" href="http://victor42.eth.limo/2874"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >&ldquo;How I Became a Designer&rdquo;</a>, gained traction, my blog became less isolated. Designers and enthusiasts I&rsquo;d never met reached out, shared experiences, asked for advice, discussed careers, offered projects, invited me to join startups, or just sought encouragement. I was overwhelmed but also touched. After three years of working mostly alone, I found a design family, a sense of belonging. These were real people, not just a forum. Everyone had unique experiences and passion. Most importantly, they were good people, worth knowing.</p>
<p>Cultivate your design network. Beyond the information you&rsquo;ll gain, the mutual support is invaluable.</p>
<h3 id="3-every-field-is-a-new-challenge-embrace-it">3. Every Field is a New Challenge, Embrace It</h3>
<p>I did graphic design for six months and then moved to web design. I can confidently discuss web structures, resolutions, browser engines, and common hex codes, but should I stop there?</p>
<p>No way. I can&rsquo;t ignore the mobile boom. I created a mobile version of my blog early on, and even though I was still in a PC mindset, it showed me mobile is a different beast. Shifting screen sizes, different units, touch interactions ‚Äì there&rsquo;s much to learn. For Apple&rsquo;s Retina screens, you double background image sizes and then compress them with CSS. You only learn this by diving in.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;design&rdquo; is broadening. App animations are becoming crucial. Button vibrations and sound effects are now design considerations. Design is no longer purely visual.</p>
<p>The more media you explore, the broader design becomes. How do you design for a colorless e-reader? What&rsquo;s the difference between a smart TV interface and PC software? How should a blind person use a phone? Open your eyes, and the hidden depths of design emerge.</p>
<h3 id="4-build-willpower-cultivate-habits">4. Build Willpower, Cultivate Habits</h3>
<p>I was a gaming addict in college, playing World of Warcraft constantly for almost two years. While I gained something (understanding good game design), three months would have sufficed. I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times before finally quitting, even though I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>If breaking a habit is tough, forming one is even harder. You need subconscious actions to train willpower.</p>
<p>Since my student days, I&rsquo;ve consistently written ‚Äì about life, movies, even weird dreams. Maybe that showed me the value of habits. Whether the habit is useful or not, forming it builds willpower.</p>
<p>I decided to do something meaningful, long-term, <em>anything</em>. I had a great idea: translate a foreign design article weekly and create a WeChat account, &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; to share them. I love English and wanted a long-term way to use it. I&rsquo;m a designer, and foreign articles are helpful. I enjoy writing, and translation is creative, plus it enriches my blog. So, I&rsquo;ve kept up this habit, hitting multiple goals, for seven months. If there&rsquo;s anything else I want to do long-term, I&rsquo;m confident I can.</p>
<h3 id="5-happiness-first">5. Happiness First</h3>
<p>The previous points indirectly improve skills, but this one directly impacts your work. An unhappy designer struggles to inspire, and their skills rarely grow. I know this from experience, having had several miserable jobs.</p>
<p>Knowing some front-end, and mostly working in startups, I naturally did two people&rsquo;s jobs. But front-end developers are scarcer than designers. My coding work increased, and eventually, the company hired another designer and had me focus on slicing. My front-end skills improved, but that wasn&rsquo;t my aim. I should have said no, but it happened, and it soured my mood. The physical toll of overtime and the anxiety of wanting out drained me, leaving no energy for design. It ended with me quitting and starting fresh.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re happy, a designer&rsquo;s mind is supercharged. Amazing ideas flow, and you create interesting things in your spare time. Party posters, crafts, concept designs ‚Äì practice is vital for growth.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being a good designer isn&rsquo;t easy. But the charm lies in the breakthrough after the struggle. It&rsquo;s like Neo flying his ship towards the Machine City in <em>The Matrix</em>. Under attack, he bursts through the clouds and sees the warm, bright skyline.</p>
<p>So, for the sunshine in your hearts, designers, full speed ahead in 2014!</p>
