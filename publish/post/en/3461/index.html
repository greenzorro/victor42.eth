    <p>Work had slowed down, and with some personal stuff happening, I&rsquo;d fallen out of touch with tech and design. After a few days, I felt <em>off</em>, like I was losing my creative spark.</p>
<p>Normally, I&rsquo;d dive back into work or explore new designs. But this time, I went further. I suspected something valuable was hidden in that &ldquo;ignorance is bliss&rdquo; mindset.</p>
<p>So, for two months, I avoided design blogs, tech news, and industry trends. I cut myself off as much as I could. I stuck to basic work, kept up my weekly translations, and that was it. My free time was all about personal life: hanging out with friends, dining out, sleeping in, gaming, reading, and watching movies. It was a great life, honestly, but it felt off.</p>
<p>Initially, I was anxious, feeling myself getting rusty. Design ideas became scarce. Then, I adapted, even got comfortable ‚Äì a no-brainer, right? Finally, I was <em>immersed</em>. A different life, a different mindset, with its own way of operating and perceiving. And new ideas started emerging, the most valuable part of this whole experiment ‚Äì I&rsquo;d successfully become a tech newbie, seeing the world from their perspective: what mattered to them, and what didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="newbies-arent-dumb-they-just-dont-care">Newbies Aren&rsquo;t Dumb, They Just Don&rsquo;t Care</h2>
<p>We tech and design people tend to look down on newbies. Like, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know you can change your profile pic by tapping? You turned off notifications and now you&rsquo;re complaining? You left your files at home? Heard of the cloud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m one of them, and I understand the &ldquo;tech ignorance.&rdquo; My tech instincts haven&rsquo;t disappeared; I can still figure things out faster than most. But now, I&rsquo;m impatient. I have novels to read and games to play.</p>
<p>My 16GB iPhone 5 was constantly complaining about low storage. I used to check storage, meticulously clear caches, and delete downloaded data. I still can&rsquo;t remember which apps let you clear the cache and which don&rsquo;t. As a newbie, I found the easiest, most drastic solution: delete WeChat and QQ, then reinstall. Boom, hundreds of MBs freed up.</p>
<p>It sounds extreme, but it&rsquo;s logical. Deleting, reinstalling, and logging back in takes five minutes, max. I know exactly how to do it. Clearing caches <em>might</em> take two minutes, but that &ldquo;might&rdquo; is key. What if it takes 15 minutes and doesn&rsquo;t even work?</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t view my phone as &ldquo;fun,&rdquo; I won&rsquo;t waste an extra minute on it. It&rsquo;s not central to my life.</p>
<h2 id="notifications-updates-who-cares">Notifications, Updates&hellip; Who Cares?</h2>
<p>My friends, Dee and Shuai, both in IT, have completely different phone setups. Dee&rsquo;s is a classic product manager: tons of folders, neatly organized by function. Shuai&rsquo;s is the opposite: few folders, many screens, endless scrolling, and red notification badges everywhere. On his home screen, the App Store badge showed over 70 updates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the classic &ldquo;red dot OCD&rdquo; debate. I used to update everything, open every notification (though not necessarily read them). It was like doing daily quests in a game ‚Äì I had to clear those exclamation marks before logging off. Dee used to tease Shuai, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a front-end engineer, and your phone looks like this?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t chime in, but I did think it reflected someone&rsquo;s self-discipline.</p>
<p>Turns out&hellip; it&rsquo;s not that at all. At some point, I became indifferent to the red dots, probably because of WeChat Official Accounts. An app can only push so many notifications; you can clear them quickly. But subscribed accounts? You follow first, worry about reading later. When notifications flood in, you become numb, and the red dots lose their significance. WeChat&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Blame me?&rdquo; You&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Blame me?&rdquo; Nobody&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a zombie apocalypse. I enter a supermarket with a gun. If there are two zombies, I&rsquo;ll eliminate them and lock the door. If there&rsquo;s a horde, even with enough canned food for 20 years, I&rsquo;m out of there.</p>
<p>Lately, apps have gotten creative with their App Store update notes. Opera Coast used to write clever one-liners; Medium wrote poems. I&rsquo;d chuckle, briefly amused. Then&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t open the app. I&rsquo;d just return to the home screen, every time.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-heck-is-a-field">What the Heck is a &ldquo;Field&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t touched front-end tech in about a year and a half. I don&rsquo;t need to anymore. I have to strain to recall some tech concepts. Now, actively avoiding tech, I was slightly worried this might be a turning point in my design career.</p>
<p>One day, I was signing up on a website, and it said &ldquo;This field is required&rdquo; next to an input box. I knew what &ldquo;field&rdquo; meant, but it felt alien. What the heck is a &ldquo;field&rdquo;? I stared at the words, wondering if the developer had mistyped something.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;cache,&rdquo; mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;m going to ask my mom this year, &ldquo;What do you think &lsquo;Clear local cache&rsquo; means?&rdquo; If she says it clears her location info, I&rsquo;ll take it, because I&rsquo;ve thought that too.</p>
<p>At work, there&rsquo;s a constant debate about a design detail: after a complex process, should there be a &ldquo;back&rdquo; button? Where should it be placed? As a newbie, my actions showed me it&rsquo;s irrelevant. I follow the product&rsquo;s flow, going in and out step by step, naturally. Let me paint the picture: task complete ‚Äì press home ‚Äì (if it&rsquo;s a battery hog like maps, double-tap home to close it) ‚Äì lock screen ‚Äì back in pocket. I found that excessive, so after some lazy attempts, I figured it out: task complete ‚Äì lock screen ‚Äì back in pocket. The key is &ldquo;back in pocket&rdquo;! That&rsquo;s my end of the process, not exiting your feature.</p>
<p>Back to being a newbie, holding this perplexing glass screen, I just want to share a song from NetEase Cloud Music to Sina Weibo. It says my Weibo authorization expired, so I need to log in again. I patiently enter my username and password. This happens frequently, in other apps too. But for the first time, I instinctively blamed NetEase, not Weibo. Then I realized, NetEase was the scapegoat.</p>
<p>If I were a <em>true</em> newbie, I might never realize that, and NetEase would be forever blamed. Tech details, product logic, I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t care. The situation tells me someone&rsquo;s at fault. Maybe I slip on a wet floor in a restaurant, and a server apologizes for the cleaning crew, and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<h2 id="are-you-reminding-me-or-am-i-reminding-you">Are You Reminding Me, or Am I Reminding You?</h2>
<p>You rarely see people using Siri, right? I understand. Talking to a device in public, hoping for the correct response, feels awkward. It&rsquo;s noisy, and it might pick up random sounds. Plus, it&rsquo;s a privacy concern; people know your business.</p>
<p>But, it <em>works</em>. I&rsquo;m walking home, listening to music, and remember I need tissues. I&rsquo;ll forget by dinner. So, I long-press the earphone button to activate Siri: &ldquo;Remind me to buy tissues at 9 PM.&rdquo; No need to even pull out my phone.</p>
<p>I used to be a productivity app fanatic: email, calendar, notes ‚Äì all front and center on my home screen&hellip; though I rarely used them. I tried every to-do app, so many well-designed ones, each with unique features. I settled on Any.do, loving its simplicity. Pull down to add a task, swipe right to complete. I categorized tasks by context: &ldquo;buy laundry detergent&rdquo; under &ldquo;life,&rdquo; &ldquo;update annotations&rdquo; under &ldquo;work,&rdquo; &ldquo;research Pixate&rdquo; under &ldquo;learning.&rdquo; Tasks with deadlines went into their calendar app, Cal. I was meticulously managing myself, precisely as Any.do intended.</p>
<p>Then I lazily used Siri once, and I couldn&rsquo;t go back. I&rsquo;m a newbie, not a pro. Bamboo reminds me to buy fruit; HR reminds me to make a name card for the new hire. What&rsquo;s the difference? At some point, I remember something I need to do, and that&rsquo;s all. Why report back to the to-do app afterward? Is it reminding me, or am I reminding it?</p>
<p>Once the reminder pops up, I don&rsquo;t need it anymore. If you could do it for me, great, tell me the result. But you can&rsquo;t, so you remind me, and I do it myself. No app can cook me scrambled eggs with tomatoes. Finishing the task on time is the best self-management. Who cares if the to-do app is a mess?</p>
<p>A good servant comes and goes as needed.</p>
<h2 id="were-penny-pinchers-especially-with-time-and-money">We&rsquo;re Penny-Pinchers, Especially with Time and Money</h2>
<p>I moved to a place with a KFC, my go-to when I can&rsquo;t decide on dinner. KFC is great; they have mobile payments, so I only need cash for my bus fare.</p>
<p>Alipay has had an 8.8% discount forever, and Bamboo and I always get it before ordering. Her phone is still on 2G, so it stalled halfway. We found a table, struggled with it for 10 minutes, finally got the discount, and ordered.</p>
<p>Sometimes I go alone, same no-network problem, probably the carrier&rsquo;s fault. I&rsquo;m too impatient to deal with it, and I don&rsquo;t want to hold up the line. Five bucks isn&rsquo;t worth two minutes of a hungry queue&rsquo;s time. If mobile payment fails, I just use cash. Pull it out, hand it over, get the change, pocket it, done. And I don&rsquo;t have to stare at a tiny screen, trying to tap even tinier buttons.</p>
<p>Same situation, two completely different reactions. Bamboo wants the discount, even if it takes 10 minutes. I&rsquo;m starving after walking across Hangzhou; I don&rsquo;t want to wait a second. Neither has anything to do with mobile payments.</p>
<p>Looking at my WeChat history with Bamboo, it&rsquo;s nothing significant. We see each other all day; urgent matters are a phone call, non-urgent things can wait till we&rsquo;re home. Even so, we&rsquo;re constantly sending each other food delivery coupons. The shifts in our chat history are revealing.</p>
<p>For a while, we&rsquo;d send each other Ele.me coupons around lunchtime. One day, she started sending Meituan coupons; I kept sending Ele.me. After a few days, I switched to Meituan too. Then, I started sending Ele.me again, and she followed. Recently, we both switched back to Meituan, almost at the same time. What happened?</p>
<p>I randomly remembered this and asked Bamboo why we kept switching. She accused me of copying her; I said she copied <em>me</em> later. We hashed it out and reached the obvious conclusion: Ele.me had a &ldquo;15 RMB off 8 RMB&rdquo; deal, so we started ordering takeout frequently. The discount dropped to &ldquo;15 RMB off 6 RMB,&rdquo; and Bamboo discovered Meituan&rsquo;s &ldquo;15 RMB off 7 RMB.&rdquo; I was slower, but one day I felt like it and installed it, and rarely opened Ele.me after that. But I didn&rsquo;t delete it, until I saw it had a &ldquo;20 RMB off 12 RMB&rdquo; deal, and I started using it again, keeping Meituan too. Obviously, Bamboo noticed as well. It didn&rsquo;t last long, of course, it was 12 RMB off! We watched it drop to &ldquo;15 RMB off 8 RMB,&rdquo; then &ldquo;10 RMB off 6 RMB.&rdquo; And we happily started sending each other Meituan coupons again.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to have a price war, nobody cares about usability.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Now, turn on your phone, glance at your home screen icons. Think, are they trying their hardest to get your attention? Look here, look here, look here! But I&rsquo;m a newbie; I just want to check the bus route to the subway. Everyone&rsquo;s enthusiasm stresses me out. I dive into the maps app, find my route, shut off my phone without looking back, and go on my way.</p>
<p>My two months as a newbie felt schizophrenic. In a good mood, I&rsquo;d tap anything, download random games and apps, and forget how I found them the next day. In a bad mood, everything was noise. I&rsquo;d pull down the notification center, it was a nightmare, and I&rsquo;d silently push it back up, pretending I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to grasp; people are so unstable. Newbies are fickle; they change their minds; opening an app is basically mood-based. During this time, I felt like my thinking was stream-of-consciousness, my actions were &ldquo;goto&rdquo; statements, unpredictable.</p>
<p>I thought the newbie state was temporary, but it&rsquo;s a great feeling, and part of it has permanently influenced me. There&rsquo;s more to say, but I don&rsquo;t want to write anymore. While writing this, the designer in me is resurfacing, the newbie feeling is fading, and there are some mindsets and perspectives I don&rsquo;t want to give up.</p>
<p>The conclusion might be a bit pessimistic, or maybe there&rsquo;s no constructive conclusion at all. But during this time, I experienced what was real, and maybe this is what tech life should be.</p>
